We then get into the economic theory of why people buy health insurance, particularly how individual health status and risk preferences affect the willingness to pay for health insurance. This is the subject of Chapters 3 and 4 (Buying Insurance). We then move from an individual’s insurance decision to the market, focusing on the problem of adverse selection and its implications for premiums and insurance coverage. This is the subject of Chapters 5 and 6 (Insurance Markets)."

Health insurance can be a confusing name because it doesn’t actually insure health, just as life insurance doesn’t actually insure your life. Instead, health insurance protects us against the financial risk from negative health events. There is some evidence that health insurance does actually improve health, mainly by ensuring access to care, but that’s not necessarily the explicit purpose of health insurance."

    "text": "3.1 Managed Care\nOne common term you will hear in connection with health insurance is managed care (Definition 3.1). “Management” in this context means that the insurer directs enrollees toward certain providers over others, usually reflecting the prices negotiated with those providers.\nFor example, suppose there are two large hospital systems in a market, and an insurer has negotiated lower payments with Hospital A. If Hospital A offers adequate quality and a wide range of services, the insurer wants enrollees to use it rather than Hospital B, since that reduces costs. To achieve this, the insurer might lower the patient’s out-of-pocket payment if care is received at Hospital A.\nThis arrangement resembles a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), in which the insurer still covers some costs at Hospital B but at a less generous rate. Alternatively, the insurer might refuse to pay for care at Hospital B altogether. This is the logic of a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), where coverage is limited to a defined set of providers. In both cases, the insurer uses financial incentives to steer patients toward preferred providers.\nPPOs and HMOs are the most common forms of managed care insurance products in the United States.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Managed Care) A health insurance product that attempts to manage utilization of health care among its enrollees, often by assigning providers (physicians, hospitals, etc.) into tiers based on negotiated prices.",

    "text": "3.2 Networks\nA central tool of managed care is the construction of a provider network (Definition 3.2). Insurers negotiate agreements with certain hospitals, physicians, and other providers, designating them as “preferred” sources of care. Providers included in these agreements are considered in-network, meaning the insurer will cover care received from them, subject to the cost-sharing rules of the plan. By contrast, out-of-network providers have no such agreement, and patients are usually responsible for the full bill if they choose to use them.\nThe financial consequences of going out-of-network can be severe. Because out-of-network bills are based on the provider’s charges (essentially a sticker price) rather than the negotiated allowed amounts, patients may face costs that are many times higher than in-network rates (see Section 5). For example, an in-network MRI might leave a patient with a $200 co-insurance bill, while the same scan out-of-network could cost the patient over $2,000.\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Insurance Networks) A set of providers for which the insurer has agreed to pay some portion of care received, conditional on other cost-sharing terms of the insurance contract. The most common network-based insurance products are Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). PPOs often use a tiered structure, where patients pay less at higher-tier providers, while HMOs typically make a sharper distinction between in-network and out-of-network coverage.\n\nNetworks and managed care are closely linked. By deciding which providers are in-network and under what terms, insurers influence where patients seek care. The possibility of exclusion from a network—or assignment to a less favorable tier—also gives insurers bargaining power when negotiating prices with providers.",

    "text": "4.2 Cost-sharing\nWhile premiums must be paid every month, cost-sharing refers to what patients pay when they actually use health care. Cost-sharing provisions determine the out-of-pocket expenses a patient faces once they receive care. The three most common forms are the deductible (Definition 4.1), co-insurance (Definition 4.2), and co-payment (Definition 4.3).\nFigure Figure 4.2 shows that over time, insurers have relied more heavily on high deductibles and co-insurance, while the use of co-payments has declined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Cost-sharing\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 4.1 (Deductible) The amount a patient must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer pays anything. For example, with a $2,000 deductible, a patient must first cover $2,000 in health care costs each year before insurance begins contributing. Once this threshold is reached, the deductible is considered “met.”\n\n\nDefinition 4.2 (Co-insurance) A percentage of costs the patient pays after meeting the deductible. For example, with a 20% co-insurance rate, a patient who has already met the deductible and then receives a $5,000 hospital bill would pay $1,000 (20%), while the insurer pays the remaining 80%. Co-insurance is common for larger, less predictable services such as hospital stays or emergency visits.\n\n\nDefinition 4.3 (Co-payment) A fixed dollar amount the patient pays for a specific service after meeting the deductible. Co-payments are more common for lower-cost, predictable services such as physician office visits or prescription drugs. For instance, a plan might require a $20 co-pay for a doctor’s visit, with the insurer covering the remainder.\n\nNote that co-insurance and co-payments can coexist within the same plan. Office visits may involve a co-payment, while hospital services may involve co-insurance. Importantly, monthly premiums are not considered cost-sharing, because they are owed whether or not any health care is used. Cost-sharing applies only to expenses incurred when care is actually received.",

In most markets, prices are relatively transparent.

The allowed amount is the negotiated rate that the provider and insurer have agreed upon.\nIf there is no such agreement (e.g., the provider is out-of-network), patients are asked to pay the full charge. Charges can exceed allowed amounts by thousands of dollars, making the distinction more than semantic.

    "section": "2.2 History of Private Health Insurance",
    "text": "2.2 History of Private Health Insurance\nLet’s start with a very brief history of private health insurance. In 1929, an innovative approach to healthcare called “hospital insurance” was introduced for schoolteachers, allowing them to receive medical care at Baylor University Hospital in Dallas, Texas. This system offered essentially pre-paid medical care for approximately 1,500 schoolteachers in the area. Teachers paid an annual fee, known as a “premium,” which amounted to $6 at the time (equivalent to $104 in 2023), providing coverage for up to 21 days of hospital care. This subscription-based model not only ensured access to healthcare for teachers but also offered a steady and reliable source of income for the hospitals, creating a sustainable financial arrangement for both parties involved.\nThe revenue model introduced by hospital insurance became widely popular and led to the establishment of Blue Cross, a network of hospitals. This network originated in Sacramento, California, in 1932 and quickly expanded. However, this structure brought about some distortions within the healthcare system. One notable distortion was the concentration of care in hospitals, even when other settings could potentially provide care at a lower cost. Additionally, the absence of price competition hindered the development of competitive pricing mechanisms. Despite these challenges, Blue Cross plans continued to grow throughout the 1930s. They operated as not-for-profit entities and enjoyed exemptions from typical regulations imposed on insurance markets. This unique approach allowed Blue Cross to play a significant role in shaping the healthcare landscape during that time.\nBlue Cross expanded its services by venturing into prepaid physician services, which became known as Blue Shield. Eventually, the two entities merged to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a prominent player in the healthcare insurance industry. By the year 1940, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans had become incredibly popular, accounting for half of all health insurance plans. In this system, hospitals were paid on a cost-plus basis, which means they received reimbursement for their expenses along with an additional percentage as profit. This payment structure will be further explained later. To foster fair competition, any other insurance plans seeking to compete with Blue Cross and Blue Shield had to offer a similar organizational structure. This consolidation and standardization within the healthcare insurance market had a significant impact on the industry’s development.",

    "section": "2.2 Employer Sponsored Insurance",
    "text": "2.2 Employer Sponsored Insurance\nThe evolution of healthcare insurance took a significant turn with the emergence of employer-sponsored insurance. This shift brought about new dynamics in how healthcare coverage was provided and financed. As the cost of healthcare continued to rise, employers recognized the need to offer comprehensive insurance benefits to attract and retain talented employees. This led to the establishment of employer-sponsored insurance plans, where employers would contract with insurance companies to provide coverage to their employees. This transition marked a pivotal moment in the history of healthcare insurance, as it expanded access to healthcare for a significant portion of the population and fundamentally changed the relationship between employment and healthcare coverage.\nDespite significant changes to health insurance markets over time, most recently introduced by the ACA, the majority of non-elderly (below age 65) adults in the U.S. continue to receive health insurance through their employer. The U.S. is one of the only developed countries to still rely on employers for health insurance, so it’s worthwhile to think briefly about how this came to be.\nThere are two important historical features of health insurance in the U.S. that contribute to our present-day reliance on employers as insurance providers. First, the stabalization act of 1942 temporarily suspended wage increases without official government approval. Without the ability to compete for workers on wages, employers turned increasingly toward more generous benefits packages, including pensions and health insurance. Second, just a decade later in 1954, the federal government made exempted insurance expenses from federal income taxes. This meant that, for individuals with some expected health care expenses, one dollar in health insurance benefits was worth more than one dollar in additional salary, since the latter would be taxed while the former would not be taxed. From the worker’s perspective, if they’re going to spend money on health care anyway, they would be better off spending that money through insurance without the tax. While there have been significant changes to the health care and health insurance landscape since the 1950s, federal policy has largely avoided any attempts to replace employer-sponsored health insurance.\nWith ESI, employers typically assume a substantial portion of the premium cost, shouldering a significant share of the financial burden. Employees contribute a smaller portion of the premium cost, often deducted from their wages on a pre-tax basis, providing some tax advantages. This arrangement allows employees to obtain coverage with reduced out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, many large employers adopt a self-funded approach, where they bear the actual cost of healthcare. In this model, the insurer acts as an administrator and negotiator, facilitating the management of the healthcare benefits. By self-funding, employers can potentially circumvent certain state-mandated benefits and state premium taxes, benefiting employers operating across state lines. This strategy provides flexibility and cost control for employers, while still ensuring the provision of essential healthcare coverage for their employees.",

    "section": "2.3 Non-group health insurance",
    "text": "2.3 Non-group health insurance\nNon-group health insurance refers to a form of health coverage that is purchased individually by individuals or families, rather than being provided by an employer or obtained through a government program. This type of insurance is typically sought by those who are self-employed, unemployed, or do not have access to employer-sponsored health plans. While this option has been available for some time, the ACA introduced significant regulations in this market as well as subsidies intended to help maintain affordability of these types of plans. Non-group health insurance, or direct purchase health insurance, remains a relatively small share of private health insurance types, but grew significantly following the ACA.\nBefore the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the non-group health insurance market posed significant challenges for individuals seeking coverage. One of the primary difficulties was the lack of access and affordability. Insurance companies had the freedom to deny coverage or charge exorbitant premiums based on pre-existing conditions, leaving individuals with health issues vulnerable and often unable to obtain adequate coverage. Additionally, insurers could impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, resulting in inadequate protection for individuals with extensive medical needs. The non-group market also lacked transparency, making it challenging for consumers to compare plans and make informed decisions about their coverage options. Furthermore, the absence of standardized essential benefits meant that individuals could end up with plans that provided limited or inadequate coverage for crucial healthcare services. Overall, the non-group market prior to the ACA was characterized by limited options, high costs, and inadequate consumer protections, leaving many individuals without the necessary coverage and financial security.\nSome of the larger changes in the non-group market introduced by the ACA included:\n\nIntroduction of Health Insurance Marketplaces: The ACA established online Health Insurance Marketplaces, also known as Exchanges, where individuals can compare and purchase health insurance plans. These Marketplaces provide a centralized platform for individuals to access a range of health insurance options, promoting transparency and competition in the non-group market.\nEssential Health Benefits: The ACA mandated that health insurance plans in the non-group market cover a set of essential health benefits. These benefits include services such as hospitalization, prescription drugs, preventive care, and mental health services. This requirement aimed to ensure that individuals have access to comprehensive coverage and that plans provide a minimum level of essential services.\nPre-existing Condition Protections: One significant change brought about by the ACA was the prohibition of denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions. This provision aimed to provide individuals with pre-existing conditions the opportunity to obtain affordable health insurance coverage in the non-group market.\nSubsidies and Financial Assistance: The ACA introduced subsidies and financial assistance to help lower-income individuals and families afford health insurance coverage in the non-group market. These subsidies are based on income and can help offset premium costs and, in some cases, reduce out-of-pocket expenses, making coverage more accessible and affordable.\nCoverage Requirements and Individual Mandate: The ACA implemented an individual mandate, which required most individuals to have health insurance coverage or face a penalty. This provision aimed to encourage broad participation in the insurance market to spread risks and stabilize premiums. However, the penalty for not having coverage was effectively eliminated starting in 2019.",

Traditional Medicare is composed of two main parts: Part A, which covers hospital services, and Part B, which covers medical services such as doctor visits and outpatient care. Part A is generally available to eligible individuals without the need for premium payments if they or their spouse have paid Medicare taxes while working. Part B, on the other hand, requires beneficiaries to pay a monthly premium.\nUnder Traditional Medicare, beneficiaries have the freedom to choose their healthcare providers and facilities, as long as they accept Medicare. This provides individuals with a wide range of options and flexibility in accessing medical services. Beneficiaries can visit any healthcare professional or hospital that participates in Medicare, ensuring access to a comprehensive network of providers across the country. Moreover, Traditional Medicare provides coverage for a broad range of medically necessary services, including but not limited to inpatient hospital stays, physician visits, diagnostic tests, outpatient surgeries, and durable medical equipment. While Traditional Medicare covers many healthcare expenses, there are certain out-of-pocket costs that beneficiaries must bear, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. To address these gaps in coverage, beneficiaries often supplement Traditional Medicare with private Medigap plans or enroll in Medicare Advantage plans, which replace Traditional Medicare and may offer additional benefits and cost-sharing options.",

These plans provide an alternative to Traditional Medicare by combining the coverage of Parts A and B into a single comprehensive health insurance plan. In addition, many Medicare Advantage plans offer additional benefits beyond what is covered by Traditional Medicare, such as prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D), vision care, dental services, and wellness programs.\nMedicare Advantage plans operate on a managed care model (Definition 1.1), which means that beneficiaries are required to use healthcare providers within the plan’s network or pay higher out-of-pocket costs for out-of-network services. These plans often employ various strategies to manage healthcare costs and improve quality, such as utilizing provider networks, implementing care coordination programs, and promoting preventive care services. Medicare Advantage plans typically charge beneficiaries a monthly premium, in addition to the Medicare Part B premium, and may involve cost-sharing arrangements such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.

Established in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is administered by states in accordance with federal guidelines and funding. The program aims to assist vulnerable populations, including low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities, in accessing essential healthcare services. Medicaid eligibility criteria vary by state but generally consider factors such as income, assets, family size, and categorical requirements.\nMedicaid offers a comprehensive range of healthcare services, including hospital care, physician visits, laboratory tests, prescription drugs, preventive care, mental health services, and long-term care. The program plays a crucial role in providing access to healthcare for individuals who may otherwise be unable to afford necessary medical services. Medicaid operates as an entitlement program, meaning that eligible individuals have the right to receive covered services. Unlike some other public assistance programs, the availability of Medicaid benefits is not limited by a fixed budget or enrollment caps. However, Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments, with the federal government providing a specified percentage of the funding based on each state’s per capita income. States have the flexibility to design their Medicaid programs within broad federal guidelines, allowing for some variation in eligibility criteria, covered services, and program administration across different states.\nMedicaid managed care has been a significant development in the delivery of healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid managed care refers to the system in which Medicaid enrollees receive their healthcare services through managed care organizations (MCOs) that contract with state Medicaid agencies. This shift towards managed care has been driven by several factors, including the desire to control healthcare costs, improve coordination of care, enhance quality outcomes, and increase beneficiary access to a broader network of healthcare providers. The expansion of Medicaid managed care has been facilitated by federal policies and incentives, such as the introduction of waivers and demonstration projects that allow states to implement managed care models. As a result, the number of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans has grown significantly over the years, leading to a transformation in how healthcare services are delivered and managed for this population.",

Established in 1930, the VA healthcare system is the largest integrated healthcare network in the country, providing a wide range of medical services to those who have served in the armed forces. The VA’s healthcare program is funded by the federal government and operates medical centers, outpatient clinics, and other healthcare facilities across the nation.\nThe VA healthcare system offers a comprehensive array of medical services, including primary care, specialty care, mental health services, preventive care, and rehabilitative services. Through its extensive network of medical centers and clinics, the VA provides a continuum of care that aims to address the unique healthcare needs of veterans. The VA’s healthcare program is characterized by its focus on care coordination, patient-centeredness, and specialized services for conditions commonly associated with military service, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Eligible veterans can access VA healthcare services with little to no cost, as the program is designed to provide coverage for a wide range of medical treatments and services. However, it is important to note that the VA healthcare system operates separately from other healthcare insurance programs in the U.S., and eligibility for VA benefits is specific to individuals who have served in the military.\nAnother source of insurance for military personal is Tri-Care. This is a comprehensive health insurance program that provides medical coverage to active duty service members, retirees, and their families. Established in 1993, Tri-Care is administered by the Department of Defense (DoD) and serves as a comprehensive health insurance program, offering various healthcare options such as managed care plans, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and fee-for-service arrangements. While both Tri-Care and the VA strive to ensure access to quality healthcare for the military community, Tri-Care caters to a broader spectrum of military personnel and their families, while the VA exclusively serves eligible veterans. Further, the VA operates as a separate healthcare system that focuses specifically on providing medical care to veterans through its network of medical centers and clinics, while Tri-Care acts as a more traditional health insurance product.",

    "text": "2.8 How public insurers pay for care\n\nPrivate Insurance (including MA)\nRegardless of how someone receives private health insurance (either through their employer, a partner’s employer, or direct purchase), the way care is paid for with private insurance is the same. The insurer has a payment that they’ve negotiated with each provider for each service. These negotiations take place in advance of any care that is delivered. Once you receive care, the provider will bill the insurance company (assuming the provider is “in-network”) and may also ask you to pay some amount directly. How much you’re asked to pay will depend on the terms of you’re insurance contract (whether you’ve met your deductible and what your copayments or coinsurance rates are).\nBut the larger point is that insurers have an agreed-upon rate for whatever services are provided, and they pay providers based on that rate. More recently, some private insurers have begun adopting some form of capitated payments with providers. While data on these contracts is relatively limited, it appears that large adopting of capitated payments tends to be isolated among insurers that also own healthcare delivery services. For example, the Kaiser system is a well-known business that operates both an insurance plan and a system of healthcare providers. We’ll talk more about capitated payments in later chapters.\n\n\nTraditional Medicare\nUnder the fee-for-service payment model for inpatient care, Medicare reimburses healthcare providers based on specific rates for different services and procedures. When a Medicare beneficiary is admitted to a hospital, the hospital submits a claim to Medicare detailing the services and treatments provided during the stay. Medicare then reviews the claim and assigns diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) to categorize the patient’s condition and treatment. Each DRG is associated with a predetermined payment amount that covers the cost of care for a typical patient with that specific condition. The payment is intended to cover the costs of the hospital stay, including room and board, nursing care, medications, and necessary medical procedures. Medicare pays the hospital a fixed amount based on the assigned DRG, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital. However, if the beneficiary requires additional services or experiences complications during the hospitalization, additional payments may be made. This fee-for-service system aims to provide hospitals with reimbursement for their inpatient services while incentivizing efficient and appropriate care.\n\n\nMedicaid\nFor states with “traditional” government-run Medicaid programs, payments to providers work similarly to traditional Medicare in that there is a predetermined fee schedule for each service or procedure. For people under Medicaid managed care, the insurer typically receives a single capitated payment per enrollee from the government, and the insurer constructs their network and negotiated rates accordingly. So for Medicaid managed care, payments to providers function more as in private insurance, just with less money per enrollee going to the insurer.\n\n\nVA\nIn the VA, care is paid for through a unique model that is distinct from traditional insurance payment systems. The VA operates its own healthcare facilities, including hospitals and clinics, and employs healthcare providers directly. As a result, the VA is a fully integrated insurer and provider. Funding for VA healthcare primarily comes from the federal government’s budget allocated to the VA. This budget covers the expenses of staffing, facilities, equipment, medications, and other necessary resources for providing healthcare services to veterans. Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare may have co-pays for certain services or medications, but these fees are typically lower than those in private insurance plans.",

    "section": "3.1 Describing Risk",
    "text": "3.1 Describing Risk\nThe more interesting question is how to quantify risk in health insurance. Before we can do that, we need to revisit a few basics. First, we need some measure of the probability that different events might occur. Second, we need some payoff from each possible event. Third, we need a way to combine those payoffs and probabilities into an expected value. And fourth, we need some notion of preferences, which in our case will be a utility function. Let’s discuss each of these elements in more detail.\n\nProbability\nProbability is defined as the likelihood that a given outcome will occur. For example, this handy/depressing risk calculator can tell me the probability of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. Let’s say that’s 10%. In this case, it would mean that if there were 1000 people exactly like me, 100 of them will develop heart disease over the next 10 years and 900 would not.\nWe’ll only work with examples where there are two possible outcomes, sick or healthy (i.e., needing health care or not needing health care). I’ll denote the probabilities of these events by \\(p_{s}\\) and \\(p_{h}\\), noting also that \\(p_{h}=1-p_{s}\\), and vice versa, since we have only two possible events.\n\n\nPayoffs\nPayoffs in this case simply reflect the monetary value of each possible outcome. Sticking with the example of getting sick or staying healthy, let’s say we will incur $500 in health care costs if we become sick and $0 if we remain healthy. If we start with $1,000, then our payoff in the event that we are sick is \\(w_{s}=1000-500=500\\), and our payoff if we remain healthy is \\(w_{h}=1000\\).\n\n\nExpected value\nQuick recap…we begin with $1,000, and we have two possible outcomes: 1) we become sick; and 2) we stay healthy. We will become sick with probability \\(p_{s}\\), in which case we’ll only have $500 left after paying for our health care. We will stay healthy with probability \\(p_{h}\\), in which case we’ll keep our original $1,000 because we don’t have to incur any health care costs.\nNow we need to form our expected payoff before the outcome is realized. With the two possible payoffs, \\(w_{s}\\) and \\(w_{h}\\), and the probabilities of each outcome, \\(p_{s}\\) and \\(p_{h}\\), we can write the expected value as simply the weighted average of the two payoffs, with the weights being the respective probabilities:\n\\[E[w] = p_{h}w_{h} + p_{s}w_{s}\\]\nKeeping the same probabilities from earlier, \\(p_{h}=0.9\\) and \\(p_{s}=0.1\\), and substituting the respective probabilities and payoffs yields an expected value of $950.\nAnother expectation that we’ll need to form is the expected cost. In our examples, we only incur a cost if we are sick. The expected cost formula looks very similar, \\(E[cost]=p_{h}cost_{h} + p_{s}cost_{s}\\), but \\(cost_{h}=0\\). So the expected cost is just \\(p_{s}cost_{s}\\), or $50.\n\n\nPreferences\nPreferences take the form of a utility function, \\(u(x)\\), which tells us how much “benefit” we get from some consumption bundle, \\(x\\). In economics, we tend to assume individuals make decisions not based on the strict monetary payoff but instead on the utility of this payoff. Among other things, this way of thinking introduces the idea of diminishing marginal utility, so that more of something means less to us if we already have a lot of it. More formally, this means \\(u'(x_{1})&gt;u'(x_{2})\\) for \\(x_{1}&lt;x_{2}\\).\nWe can then combine the notion of consumer utility with expected value in order to form the expected utility:\n\\[E[u(w)]=p_{h}u(w_{h}) + p_{s}u(w_{s})\\] As an example, let’s assume that preferences are such that \\(u(x)=\\sqrt x\\). In that case, our expected utility is 30.7. Note that we take the expectation over two different possible utility values, rather than the utility of our expected wealth. This is an important distinction and is necessary to understand risk premiums and willingness to pay for health insurance."

    "section": "3.2 Risk preferences",
    "text": "3.2 Risk preferences\nWith the basics of probability, utility, and expected value, we can begin to measure risk preferences. Generally, we categorize people into three risk types:\n\nRisk averse: Someone who prefers to avoid a risky situation and would rather take less payoff with certainty than face two possible outcomes with uncertainty.\nRisk neutral: Someone who is indifferent between the risky situation versus an uncertain outcome.\nRisk loving: Someone who prefers risk and would rather face two possible outcomes with uncertainty that receive the same outcome with certainty.\n\nFor our purposes, we will assume individuals are risk averse, which also follows from an assumption of diminishing marginal utility. Figure 3.1 provides a graphical illustration of risk aversion, showing wealth/monetary values on the x-axis and utility on the y axis. The line segment in Figure 3.1 joins two utility values, \\(u(w_{s})\\) and \\(u(w_{h})\\) — this is the expected utility line. For any probabilities \\(p_{s}\\) and \\(p_{h}\\), \\(E[u(w)]\\) will fall somewhere on that line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Depiction of risk aversion\n\n\n\n\nThe most important thing to notice from Figure 3.1 is that the line segment joining \\(u(w_{h})\\) and \\(u(w_{s})\\) falls entirely below the utility curve. Why does this matter? Let’s work through a simple thought exercise, noting that the utility curve tells us the utility for a given value of \\(w\\) in the absence of any uncertainty. Pick any value of \\(w\\) between \\(w_{s}\\) and \\(w_{h}\\) and follow that value up to the expected utility line. For any such value, you would always prefer to have that amount of wealth with certainty than in expectation. So you always prefer a single outcome with certainty over an expected outcome (of the same monetary value) with uncertainty. Another way to think of this is to pick a utility value on the y axis. Reaching that utility value will take more wealth in expectation than it would in the absence of uncertainty.\nTo fix ideas, consider another version of this graph in Figure 3.2. As drawn, providing \\(\\bar{w}\\) to this person (without any uncertainty) would yield a utility of \\(\\bar{u}\\). But if they wanted to obtain the same utility with uncertainty, they would need \\(\\bar{w} + \\pi\\). This person would need to be given more money in order to take on some uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Depiction of risk aversion"

    "text": "4.2 Risk Premium\nThe risk premium reflects how much money a risk-averse person would pay to avoid risk. In other words, it’s the amount of money that makes a person indifferent between a risky and riskless scenario. The risk premium is reflected graphically in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Depiction of risk premium\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, let’s consider someone with the utility function, \\(u(w)=\\ln(w)\\). They start with $100,000. With probability 0.25, this person will get sick and incur a cost of $20,000. Their wealth in the sick state is therefore $80,000. To find the risk premium, we need to calculate how much money they are willing to give up to avoid the risky scenario (\\(\\pi\\) in Figure 4.2). In the risky scenario, their expected utility is: \\(E[u]=0.75\\times \\ln (100000) + 0.25 \\times \\ln (80000) =\\) 11.457. We therefore need to work backward from this level of utility (the y-axis) to find the value on the x-axis that would provide the same level of utility if instead there were no risk. To do this, we take the inverse of the original utility function at the value of \\(E[u] =\\) 11.457. In this case, the inverse utility is the exponential — this is the operation we need to apply to the original utility function in order to recover the wealth value (i.e., \\(\\exp(u(w))=w\\)). So we need to take the exponential of 11.457, which yields \\(w=\\) 94,574. This value reflects the amount of wealth in a risk-free situation that would provide the same level of utility as they expect to have in the risky situation. The risk premium is then just the difference between these two wealth values, \\(\\pi =\\) 425.84.",

Intuitively, the cost of care is a transfer from the enrollee to the insurer. We have to pay that no matter what. For this reason, the expected cost of care is sometimes referred to as the “actuarily fair” premium. In our example, the actuarily fair premium is $5,000, calculated as the probability of illness times the cost of illness. Adding this to our risk premium yields the maximum WTP for health insurance, $5,425.8.",

    "section": "4.4 Determinants of WTP",
    "text": "4.4 Determinants of WTP\nFrom Figure 4.2, we can easily identify three factors that determine someone’s risk premium and WTP. The easiest way to think of how these factors affect the risk premium and WTP is to think about the gap between the expected utility line and the utility curve in Figure 4.2.\n\nCurvature of the utility function. As preferences become more risk averse, utility becomes “more curved” and the distance between the expected utility line and the utility curve increases. Therefore, risk premium and WTP are increasing with risk aversion.\nProbability of illness. This one is a little tricky. It helps to look at the extreme values with probability of illness set to 1 or 0 and note that the expected utility and utility curve intersect at those points. Since the risk premium reflects the gap between those curves, the risk premium is 0 when no such gap exists. So the risk premium is 0 when the probability of illness is 1 or 0. Hopefully this makes sense conceptually — there is no risk when the probability of illness is 0 or 1. We know with certainty that we will be either healthy or sick. We may not want to be sick, but we’re not uncertain about the outcome. And since the risk premium is what we would pay to avoid uncertainty, the risk premium is naturally 0 at those points. Extending that logic, the risk premium is largest for probability of illness of 0.5, as this is the point at which we face the most uncertainty about being sick or healthy.\nCost of illness. The cost of illness is reflected by the gap between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) in Figure 4.2. All else equal, the gap between the expected utility line and the utility curve grows as the distance between \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) increases.",

One is the role of insurers in price negotiations. An individual patient has little bargaining power relative to a hospital, and therefore little opportunity to negotiate a lower price; however, an insurance plan, in pooling the bargaining power of all of its individual members, is in a better position to negotiate lower prices. Insurance products therefore also serve to reduce the cost of illness relative to remaining uninsured. Another factor involves the information problems in health care decision-making. It can be extremely challenging to identify the “best” health care providers, and insurance plans can help with this process (although whether they actually do serve to funnel patients to higher quality providers is an empirical question).",

    "section": "5.1 Textbook Adverse Selection Model",
    "text": "5.1 Textbook Adverse Selection Model\nFigure 5.1 presents a textbook model of adverse selection, as depicted in Einav and Finkelstein (2011). The graph illustrates the interplay between price, number of enrollees, and costs in the context of health insurance, particularly in relation to adverse selection. It consists of three lines: a downward-sloping demand curve, an average cost curve, and a marginal cost curve. The vertical axis represents the price of health insurance, while the horizontal axis represents the number of enrollees.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Textbook depiction of adverse selection\n\n\n\n\nThe demand curve in Figure 5.1 reflects the willingness of individuals to pay for health insurance. As the price decreases, more individuals are willing to enroll. The average cost curve represents the average healthcare costs incurred by the insurer as the number of enrollees increases. The marginal cost curve, on the other hand, depicts the additional cost incurred by the insurer to insure one more enrollee. Note that both the demand and marginal cost curves are downward sloping, reflecting the idea that the “healthiest” individuals (people with low expected healthcare costs) are willing to pay the least for health insurance.\nWith sufficient competition, we can assume that the equilibrium point occurs where the demand curve intersects with the average cost curve. This equilibrium assumes zero profit, indicating that the insurer is covering its costs without making any additional financial gains. This equilibrium serves as a reference for analyzing the effects of adverse selection, which can introduce imbalances between the risk profile of enrollees and the corresponding costs incurred by the insurer. Of course, insurance markets are far from perfectly competitive, but the point of Figure 5.1 is to understand the role of adverse selection in prices, and in order to do that, we need to avoid other complications.\nUsing Figure 5.1, we can focus on three general scenarios: 1) full insurance; 2) under-insurance (or partial unravelling); and 3) unravelling. We’ll discuss each of these points in the remaining subsections. Throughout this discussion, we’ll assume that insurers must charge a common price for all enrollees, which is referred to as community rating in practice.\n\nFull Insurance\nIn a scenario where the demand for health insurance is consistently above the average cost, the graph would depict a situation of full insurance coverage, mitigating the problems associated with adverse selection. This is reflected in Figure 5.2. In this case, the demand curve would always intersect with the average cost curve at a point where the willingness to pay for insurance exceeds the average costs incurred by the insurer. This indicates that consumers are willing to pay a premium that sufficiently covers the expenses associated with their healthcare needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Demand always above AC\n\n\n\n\nThe graph would demonstrate a stable equilibrium where the number of enrollees satisfies the demand for insurance without compromising the financial viability of the insurer. The absence of adverse selection arises because individuals’ willingness to pay consistently surpasses the average costs, ensuring that the insurance pool is balanced and sustainable.\n\n\nUnder-insurance\nIn another version of the graph as depicted in Figure 5.1, the demand curve intersects with the average cost curve at a certain point. In such a case, underinsurance or partial unravelling occurs. This is because there are individuals who have the ability and willingness to pay more than their expected costs but choose to remain uninsured. This situation creates a gap between potential demand and actual enrollees, resulting in a mismatch between individuals’ willingness to pay and their insurance coverage. This underinsurance scenario raises concerns about access to healthcare and risk distribution in the insurance market.\n\n\nFull unravelling\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Demand always below AC\n\n\n\n\nIn a scenario where demand consistently falls below average cost on the graph, as in Figure 5.3, the health insurance market would experience complete unravelling. This signifies a lack of participation as individuals perceive the premiums as too high relative to expected costs of healthcare, resulting in insufficient demand to sustain insurance providers. The absence of a functioning market undermines risk pooling and cost-sharing mechanisms, leading to limited or no coverage. Such unravelling is sometimes referred to as a death spiral"

    "section": "5.2 What is Unravelling?",
    "text": "5.2 What is Unravelling?\nConceptually, we can describe unravelling in stages or periods. First, let’s assume that the demand curve for health insurance falls below the average cost (AC) curve beyond a certain point, although not necessarily consistently (as depicted in Figure 5.1). In the initial period, let’s assume that the insurer sets the premium at a level where average costs exceed the premium (\\(AC &gt; D\\)). This means that the insurer is undercharging for coverage, leading to financial losses.\nRecognizing the discrepancy between costs and premiums, the insurer increases the premium in the subsequent period. This price increase causes a movement upward along the demand curve. However, this upward movement prompts a specific group to exit the market—the relatively healthy or low-cost individuals. As a result, the average cost (AC) of providing coverage is also higher.\nTo reach equilibrium, the insurer must continue raising premiums as average costs increase. This ongoing process of raising premiums is driven by the departure of low-cost individuals from the market and the need to cover the higher costs of the remaining enrollees. The unraveling effect becomes evident as the insurer faces a challenging cycle of increasing premiums, losing low-cost individuals, and further elevating average costs.\nIn summary, unraveling in health insurance occurs when the demand curve falls below the average cost curve, leading insurers to set premiums that are initially too low. As costs exceed premiums, insurers raise prices, causing the departure of healthier, lower-cost individuals from the market. This exodus drives up average costs, necessitating further premium increases to reach equilibrium. This cyclical process characterizes the unraveling phenomenon in health insurance markets."

    "section": "5.3 How to deal with adverse selection",
    "text": "5.3 How to deal with adverse selection\nTo mitigate adverse selection, insurance companies employ various strategies such as risk assessment tools, underwriting processes, and pricing mechanisms based on actuarial principles to adequately manage the risk pool and ensure the financial sustainability of their operations. But in the presence of community rating, insurers inherenly rely on some projected patient costs when pricing their products, and they will be wrong in some cases. This is especially true in new markets that the exchanges introduced by the ACA, or when new regulations meaningfully change certain insurance markets.\nThere are also policy levers that can help to avoid problems of adverse selection. Three such policies include:\n\nSubsidize consumers: One potential policy solution to combat adverse selection and prevent unraveling is to subsidize consumers. By providing financial assistance or subsidies to individuals, particularly those with lower incomes or higher health risks, the affordability barrier can be addressed. Subsidies can help offset the cost of premiums, making health insurance more accessible to a broader population. By reducing the price barrier, subsidies encourage healthier individuals to participate in the insurance market, balancing the risk pool and mitigating adverse selection. This policy approach aims to maintain a healthier mix of enrollees, stabilize premiums, and promote the overall sustainability of the insurance market.\nSubsidize insurers: Another policy solution to address adverse selection and prevent unraveling is to provide subsidies directly to insurance companies. By offering financial support to insurers, it becomes possible to reduce the burden of high-risk individuals’ claims on insurance providers. Subsidies can help insurers cover the additional costs associated with providing coverage to higher-risk individuals. This reduces the financial strain on insurers, enabling them to offer more competitive premiums and remain financially viable. By providing subsidies to insurers, this approach helps to mitigate adverse selection and promotes the stability and affordability of health insurance coverage for all enrollees.\nMandate purchases: A third policy solution to address adverse selection and prevent unraveling is to mandate the purchase of health insurance. By implementing a requirement for individuals to obtain health insurance coverage, often through an individual mandate, it ensures a broader risk pool and a more balanced distribution of risks and costs. Mandating purchases encourages healthier individuals to enroll, reducing the concentration of high-risk individuals in the insurance pool. This approach promotes the spreading of risk, stabilizes premiums, and helps prevent adverse selection. Mandating purchases aims to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the health insurance market by creating a more diverse and inclusive risk pool.\n\nThese policy solutions each offer potential strategies to address adverse selection and prevent unraveling in health insurance markets. By addressing affordability barriers, supporting insurers, and creating a balanced risk pool, these policy approaches strive to promote access to comprehensive coverage, stabilize premiums, and maintain the financial viability of the insurance market."

    "section": "6.1 What is competition in health insurance?",
    "text": "6.1 What is competition in health insurance?\nWe purchase health insurance very differently than most other products, and so understanding competition in this market is conceptually harder. When it comes to employer-sponsored health insurance, there are notable differences between small and large employers. Small employers typically select insurance plans from a set of options, while their employees choose from the available plans. The employer acts as the “buyer” of the insurance product, and the insurer takes into account the expected risk profile and healthcare needs of the employees. This arrangement allows small employers to provide health insurance options to their workforce, albeit with varying levels of coverage and benefits.\nIn contrast, large employers often adopt a self-insurance model. They assume the financial risk of healthcare costs for their employees and the insurance plan primarily facilitates claims processing and network structure. As the employer directly pays for all healthcare expenses, the risk profile of the employee population becomes less crucial to the insurer and more significant to the employer themselves.\nIn other settings like the ACA exchange or Medicare Advantage, we rely on something called “managed competition.” This is a concept that involves private insurers operating within a highly regulated framework, often (but not always) alongside public insurers or government programs. Examples of managed competition include fully private insurers participating in insurance exchanges, private insurers replacing Medicaid through Medicaid managed care, and private insurers coexisting with public insurers in Medicare Advantage programs. These scenarios are subject to significant federal and state regulations, ensuring consumer protections and maintaining standards of care."

    "section": "6.2 Risk adjustment",
    "text": "6.2 Risk adjustment\nAs we saw in the last Chapter, adverse selection can play a large role in private health insurance markets. For example, insurers may seek to attract healthier individuals, leaving those with higher healthcare needs in underinsured or higher-cost plans.\nIf we want to rely on a market based system for health insurance, we need to deal with adverse selection. Rather than allowing insurers to set prices individually, we tend to introduce risk adjustment as a wedge between the prices paid by enrollees and the fees received by insurers. For example, in Medicare Advantage, enrollees pay uniform premiums, while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pays different amounts to insurers based on enrollee characteristics. Additional solutions include plan lock-in and open enrollment periods to manage adverse selection.\nIn the context of Medicare Advantage, which historically had fewer healthy enrollees than the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, the implementation of a new risk adjustment system from 2003 to 2006 resulted in significant changes. Prior to the implementation, Medicare Advantage enrollees utilized only 60% of the care compared to traditional Medicare, while individuals who switched to traditional Medicare used 160% more care than the average beneficiary. However, with the new risk adjustment system, the health differences between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare declined to less than 5%. This implementation aimed to reduce favorable selection and promote greater equity in Medicare Advantage.\nDespite the benefits of risk adjustment, challenges persist. Predicting who will require the most care proves to be difficult, with risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage predicting less than 15% of the observed variation in healthcare utilization. However, mean predictions tend to be relatively close. Other barriers include the need for interpretability and the prevention of manipulation by insurers. The ultimate goal of risk adjustment is to reduce incentives for insurers to disproportionately target healthy individuals without encouraging them to manipulate the risk scores of their enrollees. By addressing these challenges, risk adjustment can continue to play a vital role in fostering fairness and equity within health insurance markets."

    "section": "6.3 Managed competition",
    "text": "6.3 Managed competition\nManaged competition in health insurance arises due to the need to “manage” competition in markets that are typically highly concentrated. In these markets, demand for insurance tends to be relatively price-inelastic, resulting in limited pressure for more efficient and higher-quality insurance products. The concentration of insurers in the Medicare Advantage (MA) market is particularly pronounced, with a majority of markets being dominated by no more than three insurers holding over 95% market share. Several factors contribute to this market power, including high fixed entry costs, network restrictions imposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the need for network structures.\nAs a concrete example, let’s consider the case of MA pricing. The pricing structure in the MA market is based on a bid-and-rebate system. Insurers set a bid (plan price), while CMS establishes a risk-adjusted benchmark rate, \\(B\\), derived from Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) costs. If the bid, \\(b\\), is lower than the benchmark rate, the plan receives the bid amount plus a percentage of the difference between the benchmark rate and the bid as a rebate from CMS. Conversely, if the bid exceeds the benchmark rate, the plan receives the benchmark rate from CMS, and the difference becomes the premium charged to the enrollee.\nTo maximize their profits, plans in the MA market solve an optimization problem by determining the price, \\(p\\), that maximizes their profit function, considering costs per enrollee, \\(c\\), and quantity, \\(Q\\), of enrollees. Putting profit function in terms of risk units, the plan’s problem is:\n\\[\\max_{p_{j}} \\left(p_{j} + B - c_{j} \\right) Q_{j}(p_{j}, p_{-j}),\\]\nwhere \\(p_{j}\\) is the plan’s price, \\(c_{j}\\) is their cost per enrollee, and \\(Q_{j}\\) is plan j’s quantity (in risk units). This yields an optimal pricing condition of:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d \\pi}{d p_{j}} = Q_{j}(p_{j}, p_{-j}) + \\frac{d Q_{j}}{d p_{j}} ( p_{j} + B - c_{j}) &= 0 \\\\\n  p_{j} + B - c_{j} = \\frac{ - Q_{j} }{ \\frac{d Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}} &= \\left(\\frac{d \\ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n  p_{j}  &= c_{j} - B + \\left(\\frac{d \\ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n  b_{j}  &= c_{j} + \\left(\\frac{d \\ln Q_{j}}{d p_{j}}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe optimal price is influenced by the sensitivity of enrollment to plan benefits, with more competitive plans experiencing a larger response to changes in benefits. Empirical evidence suggests a price elasticity where a 10% increase in enrollment is associated with a $10 reduction in the bid, implying markups of 10-25% over costs.\nStudies such as Curto et al. (2021) have analyzed the impact of managed competition in the MA market. Findings indicate that MA plans deliver care at a lower cost than traditional Medicare fee-for-service, but bids are higher than what Medicare would have paid in FFS. This results in nearly 15% higher costs to taxpayers, with approximately 40% of excess payments going to enrollees in the form of additional consumer surplus, while 60% is retained by insurers.\nThe key takeaway from these findings is that market design plays a crucial role in health insurance. Changes in rebate calculations and benchmark rates are being implemented to address these issues. Evaluating the success of managed competition requires considering factors such as offering the same product at a lower cost than a public insurer, providing a better product at the same cost, or achieving greater cost savings with a “good enough” product, even if it falls short of the public insurer’s quality.\nIn conclusion, managing competition in health insurance markets, particularly in the context of Medicare Advantage, involves addressing market power, optimizing pricing strategies, and evaluating the impact on costs and consumer outcomes. Market design and ongoing policy adjustments are essential in shaping the success and effectiveness of managed competition in achieving efficient and high-quality healthcare coverage."

    "text": "12.1 History of Hospitals in the U.S.\nThe historical timeline of hospital care in the U.S. presents intriguing phases. Before 1900, seeking hospital care was not a prevalent practice, particularly due to the prevailing charity-based care system. Hospitals served as learning or even experimental environments for physicians during this period. The early 1900s saw significant advancements in safety and technology. The mid-1900s witnessed expansive growth, particularly in affluent urban areas. The introduction of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 marked a pivotal shift in healthcare financing. Originally, hospitals were reimbursed under a “cost-plus” framework.\nIn the contemporary landscape, U.S. hospitals primarily operate as not-for-profit entities, but we’ll discuss this more in the next chapter. They often maintain affiliations with universities and religious organizations. Urban areas benefit from concentrated hospital services, while rural regions face limited access. The pricing landscape remains opaque, with historically little cost management strategies in place.\nThe past three decades have witnessed substantial technology integration within hospitals. This period has also seen a shift towards quality improvement initiatives, pay-for-performance models, and variants of capitation. Efforts to increase transparency in pricing have emerged. However, competitiveness has dwindled, giving rise to increased vertical integration, such as hospitals owning physician practices or insurers acquiring hospitals."

    "text": "12.2 Hospital Prices\nThe escalating healthcare expenditure in the U.S. has drawn attention to the significant role of high healthcare prices, particularly those associated with hospitals. Understanding the dynamics of hospital markets and pricing becomes imperative in addressing the broader challenge of healthcare spending. In one way, understanding hospital “pricing” is simple in that it derives from a bilateral negotiation with insurers. Hospitals lack unilateral authority to set prices and engage in a bargaining process where insurers and hospitals share a predetermined total amount. The party with greater bargaining power typically secures a larger share.\nBut in practice, a defining feature of hospital pricing and services is their inherent complexity. For one, multiple payers are involved, each offering distinct prices. Medicare, for example, pays according to their FFS schecule, medicare fee-for-service prices. Medicaid does the same, medicaid payments. And there are several privatized elements within these programs, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care, wherein insurers and hospitals negotiate over prices but with an indirect (but binding) ceiling on those prices imposed by federal and state policies. These different payers contribute to the complex pricing landscape prevalent in U.S. healthcare today.\nMoreover, we have slightly different notions of “prices” depending on who you ask. These include things like “charges”, “costs”, or “out-of-pocket spending.” A particularly confusing element of this is what’s called the hospital “charge”. These figures are kind of like a list price—they reflect what the hospital would like to get paid for a service. But these figures are astronomically high in many cases and are largely unrelated to costs or other negotiated prices.\nThe complexity introduced by different insurers and different notions of “price” is evident in the data, as reflected in Figure 12.1. Here, we see significant differences between a hospital’s “charge” amount, the Medicare FFS amount, and the negotiated payment rate with commercial insurers.\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Different “Prices”\n\n\nIn addition to differences in the definition of prices and difference across payers, the nature of the pricing negotiation with insurers introduces additional complexity. For example, fee-for-service pricing involves pricing per procedure, but this price could be based off a percentage of charges or a markup over Medicare rates. Since negotiating as a percent of charges involves less downside risk, hospital with more market power tend to be more able to negotiate as a percentage of charges, and hospitals with lesser market power tend to rely more on negotiations as a markup over Medicare rates. In addition, some insurers and hospitals negotiate prices with capitation, in which hospitals are paid essentially per patient in their area, with some form of shared savings agreements across providers.\nAll of this means that, even among negotiated commercial insurance prices in the same market, we can see significant variation in prices. Such variation is depicted in Figure 12.2. Even for a homogeneous product like lower limb MRIs, prices from the highest-price provider can be more than 2x higher than that of the lowest-price provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Hip Replacement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Lower Limb MRI\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Hospital prices within Atlanta area HRR"

    "title": "13  Ownership and Objective Functions",
    "section": "13.1 Hospital Ownership Types",
    "text": "13.1 Hospital Ownership Types\nThere are three main types of hospitals in the US. Private not-for-profit hospitals account for the majority of hospitals in the US, about 60%. Private for-profit hospitals account for about 20% of hospitals in the US, and the remaining 20% are public not-for-profit hospitals, which are owned by state or local governments. But what does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital? What does it mean to be a for-profit hospital? And how might these differences relate to hospital behaviors or underlying objective functions? The role of profit status and the underlying hospital objective function is the subject of this chapter.\n\nNot-for-profit Hospitals\nFrom a practical perspective, being a not-for-profit hospital means that the hospital is exempt from paying federal, state, and local taxes. In exchange for this tax exemption, not-for-profit hospitals are expected to provide a certain amount of community benefit. This community benefit can include uncompensated care, services to Medicaid patients, and certain specialized services that are generally unprofitable. The community benefit is not well defined, and there is no consensus on how to measure it. In 2011, not-for-profit hospitals received $24.6 billion in tax exemptions and provided $62.4 billion in community benefits. This is a large amount of money, and it is not surprising that there is some controversy surrounding the tax-exempt status of not-for-profit hospitals.\nFor some background on the controversy surrounding not-for-profit hospitals, see the following articles:\n\nWashington Post Article\nNYTimes Article\nUnfortunately still an issue 10+ years later:\n\nDo Nonprofit Hospitals Deserve Their Tax Exemption?, NEJM, 2023\nInterview with NEJM Authors\n\n\nPublic not-for-profit hospitals rely more heavily on state and local government funding than private not-for-profit hospitals. Public not-for-profit hospitals are often the “safety net” hospitals of the area, and they tend to have a large share of uninsured or Medicaid patients. Because public not-for-profit hospitals tend to receive such a large share of Medicaid and uninsured patiehts, the tax breaks and other benefits conveyed to public not-for-profit hospitals tend to be less controversial.\n\n\nFor-profit Hospitals\nFor-profit hospitals are owned by private entities, investors, or corporations. The primary objective of for-profit hospitals is to generate financial returns for shareholders or individual owners. For-profit hospitals still provide medical services, and they are still subjected to a variety of regulations. However, for-profit hospitals more explicitly value profits as a key objective."

    "section": "13.2 Objective Functions",
    "text": "13.2 Objective Functions\n\nUtility Maximizers\nAs economists, the real question is…what is the hospital’s objective function? Does not-for-profit status actually reflect a different objective than for-profit? Or is it just a tax status? There are a few different ways to think about this. In general, we can think of a hospital as maximizing some utility function, \\(u(q,z)\\), subject to a production constraint. Here, \\(q\\) denotes quantity of care and \\(z\\) denotes quality of care, and production is constrained by a break-even condition. This utility function could include profits, social welfare, or some other measure of hospital performance. The utility function could also include other factors, such as patient satisfaction, which is often used as a measure of quality.\nA simplified utility maximization problem is reflected in Figure 13.1. Here, the hospital is maximizing utility subject to a break-even condition. The break-even condition is the point where the hospital’s revenue equals its costs. The hospital’s revenue is determined by the demand curve, and the hospital’s costs are determined by the average cost curve. The hospital’s utility function is represented by the indifference curves. The hospital will choose the quantity of care that maximizes utility, which is the point where the indifference curve is tangent to the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Utility maximizing hospital\n\n\n\n\nWe can imagine a hospital repeating this utility maximization problem over several different hypothetical combinations of quality and quantity of care. The result is a production possibilities curve (PPC), which is shown in Figure 13.2. The PPC shows the maximum quantity of care that the hospital can provide for each level of quality. The PPC is downward sloping because the hospital must sacrifice quantity in order to increase quality. The PPC is also convex because the hospital faces increasing marginal costs. The slope of the PPC is determined by the marginal rate of substitution between quality and quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Utility maximizing hospital\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is generally difficult to form any precise predictions of hospital behavior under such a general setting, there are some predictions that we can make. For example, imaging a new state or federal policy that expands insurance access to many more individuals. In shifting demand for care outward, we can predict that this policy would cause the hospital to choose a point on the PPC that is further to the right, thereby increasing the quantity of care. Similarly, if the policy increased the cost of providing care, we can predict that the hospital would choose a point on the PPC that is further to the left, thereby decreasing the quantity of care. These are not groundbreaking predictions, but they are useful in thinking about how hospitals might respond to policy changes.\n\n\nFor profits (in disguise)\nHosptitals might instead care primarily about profits. This is presumably the case among for-profit hospitals, but might also be the case even for otherwise not-for-profit hospitals. For profits are easier to predict and study theoretically as their objective is simply to maximize profits, \\(\\pi=P(q)q - C(q),\\) where \\(q\\) denotes quantity of care. We could also introduce quality of care into this problem, as part of the demand and cost functions.\nMost empirical evidence doesn’t find much of a difference between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals, suggesting that profits are at least part of the objective even for not-for-profit hospitals. One way in which for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals are empirically different, however, is with regard to prices. Here, for-profit hospitals have been shown to have much higher prices than not-for-profit hospitals on average."

We assume that \\(p_{g}\\) is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, \\(p_{i,j}\\).\nThe hospital chooses \\(p_{i}\\) such that\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \\pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0\\]\nwhere \\(U_{1}\\) denotes the derivative of \\(U(\\cdot)\\) with respect to its first argument and similarly for \\(U_{2}\\). In general, we can’t solve this directly without knowing the hospital’s utility function. But we can say something about the potential relationship between \\(p_{i}\\) and \\(p_{g}\\), which we’ll turn to in the next chapter.\n\n\n14.1.2 For FP objective functions\nIf we instead assumse that the hospital maximizes \\(\\pi_{i,j}\\) (e.g., the profit from insurer \\(i\\)), then this takes the form of a standard price-setting problem for a monopolisitcally competitive firm, illustrated in Figure 14.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: For-profit Price-setting\n\n\n\n\nAs a simple example, consider a firm with (inverse) demand curve, \\(d=16-q\\), and cost curve, \\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\\). We want to find the firm’s price, the quantity at that price, and their markup over marginal costs (just for fun).\nLet’s first write out the profit function, \\(\\pi = (16-q)q - 5 - q^{2}\\). Differentiating with respect to quantity yields \\(-q + 16 - q - 2q= 16-4q=0\\), or \\(q=4\\). At this quantity, the price is \\(p=12\\), which is a markup of 4 over the marginal cost (or 50% markup). This should all feel very familiar from your intro and intermediate microeconomics courses."

The presence of cost-shifting somewhat assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example, hospitals have very low margins (possibly negative if the public price is too low), the insurer wants to sustain the hospital for competition purposes, or the hospital has diminishing returns to profits. However, economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers or health services researchers. The argument over cost-shifting can actually get pretty intense, wich some academics adament that it can’t happen and others adament that it is a strong force."

    "section": "16.2 Bargaining in Health Care",
    "text": "16.2 Bargaining in Health Care\nGowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town (2015) (GNT) extend the Nash bargaining framework to consider a hospital-insurer negotiation.1 The authors describe a two-stage bargaining process, where in stage one, hospitals and insurers negotiate the terms of their agreement, and in stage two, individuals receive health draws which dictate their health care needs. They solve the problem working backward, finding patient choice probabilities based on prices, and then solving for prices. They take as given the employer-insurer relationship, essentially avoiding any concerns regarding employers changing insurers or patients choosing different health care plans.\nWe denote consumers by \\(i\\), insurance companies by \\(m\\), hospitals by \\(j\\), and diseases by \\(d\\). In the second stage (conditional on the prices and networks negotiated in the first stage), each patient receives a random health draw which determines the different conditions a patient has in a given time period. Denote by \\(f_{mid}\\) the probability that patient \\(i\\) enrolled in MCO \\(m\\) has disease \\(d\\) (\\(d=0\\) implies no disease). Further denote by \\(w_{d}\\) the weights reflecting the relative intensity of resource use for illness \\(d\\), with \\(w_{0}\\) normalized to 0. The authors assume that the insurer and hospital negotiate a base price, to which all other payments are adjusted using the relative weight. This means that the price paid for a given treatment is \\(p_{mj} \\times w_{d}\\).\n\n16.2.1 Patients\nEach patient has a coinsurance rate, denoted \\(c_{mit}\\), which reflects the percent of the price for which the patient is responsible. Upon realizing disease \\(d\\), the patient chooses the hospital \\(j\\) in their network (\\(N_{m}\\)) that maximizes their utility, where each patient’s utility function is given by: \\[u_{mijd} = \\beta x_{mijd} - \\alpha c_{mid} w_{d} p_{mj} + e_{mij}.\\] Here, \\(x_{mijd}\\) denotes a vector of hospital and patient characteristics, and \\(e_{mij}\\) is an iid error term assumed to follow a Type I extreme value distribution.\nBased on the assumed error term distribution, the patient’s probability of choosing hospital \\(j\\) is given by \\[s_{mijd}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) = \\frac{\\exp (\\beta x_{mijd} - \\alpha c_{mid} w_{d} p_{mj})}{\\sum_{k}\\exp (\\beta x_{mikd} - \\alpha c_{mid} w_{d} p_{mk})},\\] where \\(\\sum_{k}\\) denotes the sum over all \\(k\\) hospitals in the patient’s network as well as their outside option. With these choice probabilities, the expected number of patients admitted to hospital \\(j\\), weighted by the relative intensity of resource use, is \\[q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{I_{m}} \\sum_{d=1}^{D} f_{mid} w_{d} s_{mijd}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}).\\]\nIn addition to choice probabilities, the error term assumptions provide a closed form expression for consumer surplus, \\[W_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\sum_{i=1}^{I_{m}} \\sum_{d=1}^{D} f_{mid} \\ln \\left( \\sum_{k}\\exp (\\beta x_{mikd} - \\alpha c_{mid} w_{d} p_{mk}) \\right).\\] The difference between \\(W_{m}\\) with and without hospital \\(j\\) in the patient’s network, \\(W_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) - W_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})\\), then serves as an estimate of the patient’s willingness to pay for hospital \\(j\\).\n\n\n16.2.2 Insurers\nTo specify the payoff to the insurer, we first define the expected cost to the MCO for a given hospital and associated prices, \\[TC_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})=\\sum_{i=1}^{I_{m}} \\sum_{d=1}^{D} (1 - c_{mid}) \\times \\sum_{j\\in N_{m}} p_{mj} f_{mid} s_{mijd}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}).\\] With this, the value for the MCO is \\[V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) = \\tau W_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) - TC_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}),\\] where \\(\\tau\\) is the relative weight placed on employee welfare. The net value that MCO \\(m\\) receives from including system \\(s\\) in its network is then \\(V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})\\).\nThere are \\(M \\times S\\) potential contracts between hospitals and MCOs, where each contract reflects an agreed-upon based price for one MCO/hospital pair. Note that insurers and hospitals bargain over this base price to the hospital, not over a specific price for each procedure. Instead, the procedure-based prices are derived from the disease weight \\(w_{d}\\) and the contracted base price. This approximates how actual contracts are negotiated, as it is not feasible to negotiate prices for every procedure separately for every hospital and MCO.\n\n\n16.2.3 Hospitals\nFinally, we need to specify hospital payoffs. Hospital \\(j\\)’s marginal cost for services provided to patients in MCO \\(m\\) is given by \\[mc_{mj}=\\gamma \\nu_{mj} + \\varepsilon_{mj},\\] where \\(\\nu_{mj}\\) denotes a set of cost shifters, \\(\\gamma\\) are parameters to estimate, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is unobserved to the econometrician. The overall profit for hospital \\(j\\) for a given set of MCO contracts (denoted \\(M_{s}\\)), is \\[\\pi_{s}\\left(M_{s},\\{\\vec{p}_{m}\\}_{m\\in M_{s}},\\{N_{m} \\}_{m\\in M_{s}} \\right)=\\sum_{m\\in M_{s}} \\sum_{j \\in J_{s}} q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) \\left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \\right].\\] It follows that the net value that system \\(s\\) receives from including MCO \\(m\\) in its network is \\[\\sum_{j \\in J_{s}} q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) \\left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \\right].\\]\n\n\n16.2.4 Nash Bargaining Solution\nThe authors then derive the Nash bargaining solution as the choice of prices maximizing exponentiated product of the net value from agreement: \\[\\begin{align*}\nNB^{m,s} \\left(p_{mj, j\\in J_{s}} | \\vec{p}_{m,-s}\\right) &= \\left(\\sum_{j\\in J_{s}}q_{mj}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m}) \\left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \\right]\\right)^{b_{s(m)}} \\\\\n& \\times \\left(V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})\\right)^{b_{m(s)}},\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(b_{s(m)}\\) is the bargaining weight of system \\(s\\) when facing MCO \\(m\\), \\(b_{m(s)}\\) is the bargaining weight of MCO \\(m\\) when facing system \\(s\\), and \\(\\vec{p}_{m,-s}\\) is the vector of prices for MCO \\(m\\) and hospitals in systems other than \\(s\\). We can normalize bargaining weight such that \\(b_{s(m)} + b_{m(s)} = 1\\).\nNote that taking the natural log of the objective does not change the maximum, since the natural log is a ``monotonic transformation.’’ In other words, the log will change the value of some function \\(f(x)\\), but it will not change the order, so that if \\(f(x_{1})&gt;f(x_{2})\\), it follows that \\(\\ln (f(x_{1})) &gt; \\ln (f(x_{2}))\\). The resulting first order condition yields:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d \\ln (NB^{m,s})}{p_{mj}} &= b_{s(m)} \\frac{d q_{mj} + \\sum_{k\\in J_{s}} \\frac{d q_{mk}}{d p_{mj}} \\left[p_{mk}-mc_{mk}\\right]}{\\sum_{k\\in J_{s}} q_{mk}\\left[p_{mk}-mc_{mk}\\right]} + b_{m(s)} \\frac{\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}}}{V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})} \\\\\n&= 0 \\end{align*}\\]\nWe can then rearrange this equation to write:\n\\[q_{mj} + \\sum_{k\\in J_{s}} \\frac{d q_{mk}}{d p_{mj}} \\left[p_{mk}-mc_{mk}\\right] = -\\frac{b_{m(s)}}{b_{s(m)}} \\frac{\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}} \\sum_{k\\in J_{s}} q_{mk}\\left[p_{mk}-mc_{mk}\\right]}{V_{m}(N_{m},\\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\\vec{p}_{m})}\\]\nBy assumption, the first order conditions are separable across insurers. Combining all first order conditions therefore yields the following system of equations: \\[q + \\omega (p-mc) = -\\lambda (p-mc),\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are each \\(J_{s} \\times J_{s}\\) matrices, while \\(q\\) and \\(p-mc\\) are \\(J_{s} \\times 1\\) vectors. We can then solve for prices:\n\\[p = mc - (\\omega + \\lambda)^{-1} q \\tag{16.1}\\]\n\n\n16.2.5 The Impact of Prices on Managed Care Networks\nUnderstanding how prices change in response to other variables depends largely on \\(\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}}\\). Under some assumptions, the authors show that this derivative is \\[-q_{mj}-\\alpha \\sum_{i}\\sum_{d}\\gamma_{id}c_{id}(1-c_{id}) \\left(\\sum_{k\\in N_{m}} p_{mk}s_{ikd} - p_{mj}\\right),\\] where \\(\\gamma_{id}\\) includes several terms including disease weights and probability of disease. Recall that \\(c_{id}\\) denotes the coinsurance rate, while the final term in parenthesis is the difference between hospital \\(j\\)’s price and the weighted average price of all other hospitals (weighted by their market share).\nThe presence of \\(c_{id}\\times (1-c_{id})\\) illustrates the role of insurer coinsurance rates in steering patients from higher price to lower price hospitals. If \\(p_{mj}\\) is high relative to the weighted average price of other hospitals, then \\(\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}}\\) is less negative due to the term in parenthesis, and thus it is optimal (in the sense of maximizing joint surplus) to allow \\(p_{mj}\\) to increase so as to channel customers to the low price hospital. The insurer can influence the role of the term in parenthesis by manipulating \\(c_{id}\\). In the extreme cases, at \\(c_{id}=1\\) the insurer wouldn’t care about negotiating price with physicians since all of the extra cost is borne by patients. Conversely, at \\(c_{id}=0\\) the term in parenthesis is again irrelevant as the patients do not switch to lower price hospitals.\n\n\n16.2.6 The Impact of Bargaining on Prices\nThe presence of \\(\\frac{d q_{mj}}{d p_{mj}}\\) is standard, effectively meaning that firms are more limited in their markup of prices over marginal cost in markets with price-sensitive customers. The presence of \\(\\lambda\\) in Equation 16.1 illustrates the additional effect on prices due to bargaining. To see this more clearly, consider the special case of a single-hospital system. Here, the pricing equation is\n\\[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} = -q_{mj} \\left(\\frac{d q_{mj}}{d p_{mj}} + q_{mj} \\times \\frac{b_{m(j)}}{b_{j(m)}} \\times \\frac{\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}}}{\\triangle V_{m}} \\right)^{-1}\\]\nThe term \\(\\triangle V_{m}\\) is positive by construction. With some work, we can find that \\(\\frac{d V_{m}}{d p_{mj}}&lt;0\\) under most conditions. This means that the presence of bargaining tends to increase the ``effective’’ price sensitivity and reduce hospital margins relative to standard pricing conditions. However, note that this result does not always hold. In cases where some hospitals are particularly higher priced than others, then the insurer may allow a given hospital to increase its margins (relative to standard pricing conditions) so as to steer patients away from the very high priced hospital.\n\n\n\n\nDor, Avi, Michael Grossman, and Siran M Koroukian. 2004. “Hospital Transaction Prices and Managed-Care Discounting for Selected Medical Technologies.” American Economic Review, 352–56.\n\n\nGowrisankaran, Gautam, Aviv Nevo, and Robert Town. 2015. “Mergers When Prices Are Negotiated: Evidence from the Hospital Industry.” American Economic Review 105 (1): 172–203.\n\n\nLewis, Matthew, and Kevin Pflum. 2015. “Diagnosing Hospital System Bargaining Power in Managed Care Networks.” American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 7 (1): 243–74."

    "section": "17.1 Effects of Competition on Prices and Quality",
    "text": "17.1 Effects of Competition on Prices and Quality\nLet’s consider (very generally) how competition seems to be changing. First, look at some of the graphs from Gaynor, Ho, and Town (2015). These graphs tell a clear story about the increased concentration in healthcare. As a reference point for Figures 1 and 2, note that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice define “highly concentrated” as an HHI of at least 2,500 and define “unconcentrated” as an HHI of less than 1,800. HHI stands for Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, and is calculated as the sum of squared market shares. High values indicate the market is highly concentrated (i.e., the market is dominated by very few large firms).\nThese numbers show that the nature of competition in hospital markets is definitely changing. But let’s think about whether competition may be good or bad in healthcare? I don’t like that question because it is rarely an issue of whether to have competition or not but more about how much competition we should have. Nonetheless, what do you think? From a policy perspective, this matters for two competing reasons: 1) there is a sense in health policy circles that more competition is bad for hospitals, which has led to the creation of certificate-of-need (CON) laws and other barriers to entry; and 2) from a perspective of antitrust, we should be wary of mergers if they are going to increase prices.\n\n17.1.1 Competition with Fixed Prices\nWe start by considering models in which prices are fixed. This would apply, for example, in the study of Medicare or Medicaid wherein hospitals and physicians receive a set amount for a given inpatient stay or procedure.\nGaynor and Town (2012) and Gaynor, Ho, and Town (2015) summarize a model of hospital behavior with fixed prices. They consider the case in which hospitals choose a level of quality and where prices are administratively set (e.g., by Medicare). The model begins with a demand specification, \\[q_{j}=s_{j}(z_{j}, \\mathbf{z}_{\\setminus j}) \\times D(\\bar{p}, z_{j}, \\mathbf{z}_{\\setminus j}),\\] where the hospital’s market share \\(s_{j}\\) is a function of its own quality \\(z_{j}\\) and the quality of other hospitals \\(\\mathbf{z}_{\\setminus j}\\), and where total market demand is similarly determined by quality as well as the administratively set price \\(\\bar{p}\\). They further specify hospital costs as \\[c_{j}=c(q_{j},z_{j}) + F,\\] where \\(F\\) denotes fixed costs of entry, with hospital profits denoted \\[\\pi_{j} = \\bar{p}q_{j} - c_{j}.\\] Assuming hospitals are maximizing profits (relaxing this assumption in certain ways amounts to a reduction in the marginal cost of quality, and thus a higher level of quality, but no change to the comparative statics), then hospitals will choose the level of quality such that:\n\\[\\frac{d \\pi_{j}}{d z_{j}} = \\left(\\bar{p} - \\frac{d c_{j}}{d q_{j}} \\right)\\left(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}D + s_{j}\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}} \\right) - \\frac{d c_{j}}{d z_{j}}=0 \\tag{17.1}\\]\nFrom this, we can immediately see that quality is increasing with competition. Specifically, since \\(s_{j}=1\\) for a monopolist, the term \\[\\left(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}D + s_{j}\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}} \\right)=\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}}.\\] Since \\(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}&gt;0\\) by assumption, then this same term will be larger with several firms relative to a monopolist. Assuming that there is some amount of competition in the market, then the actual welfare effects depend on \\(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}\\) and \\(\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}}\\). For example, if \\(\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}}\\) is sufficiently small, then changes in quality have little effect on market demand and primarily serve to shift market share. In this case, more competition may decrease welfare if the benefit to consumers via increases in quality do not offset the entry costs of firms.\nThe example given in Gaynor and Town (2012) is useful to illustrate this point. Assume one year of life is valued at $100,000, and assume an increase in quality leads to one additional life-year for every sick person. With 1,000 sick people, any fixed entry costs of less than $100,000,000 would imply that increased quality (through increased hospital competition) is beneficial to consumers. But if at some point the additional quality benefits are sufficiently low, then fixed costs of entry may exceed those benefits and more quality may be welfare decreasing.\nMultiplying all of the terms in \\(\\ref{eqn:gaynor_fixedprice}\\) by \\(\\frac{z_{j}}{D s_{j}}\\), we can manipulate the first order condition to find: \\[\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\left(\\bar{p} - \\frac{d c_{j}}{d q_{j}} \\right) \\left(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}D + s_{j}\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}} \\right) - \\frac{d c_{j}}{d z_{j}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{z_{j}}{D s_{j}} \\left(\\bar{p} - c_{q} \\right) \\left(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}D + s_{j}\\frac{d D}{d z_{j}} \\right) - \\frac{z_{j}}{D s_{j}} c_{z} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\bar{p} - c_{q} \\right) \\left(\\frac{d s_{j}}{d z_{j}}\\frac{z_{j}}{s_{j}} + \\frac{d D}{d z_{j}}\\frac{z_{j}}{D} \\right) - \\frac{z_{j}}{D s_{j}} c_{z} \\\\\n&= \\left(\\bar{p} - c_{q} \\right) \\left(\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{D} \\right) - \\frac{z_{j}}{D s_{j}} c_{z} \\\\\nz_{j} &= \\left(\\bar{p} - c_{q} \\right) \\left(\\eta_{s} + \\eta_{D} \\right) \\frac{D s_{j}}{c_{z}}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFrom this, we see that quality is increasing in \\(\\bar{p}\\), increasing in share and demand elasticities, increasing in market share and market demand, and decreasing in marginal cost.\n\n\n17.1.2 Competition with Market Prices\nOutside of public payers, prices are generally set by the provider or through some bi-lateral negotiation process between providers and insurers. Naturally, these models are more complicated as now we are allowing both quality and price to be determined endogenously in the model.\nDorfman and Steiner (1954) provide a simple model of price and advertising, which Gaynor, Ho, and Town (2015) discuss in the context of price and quality in healthcare. Dorfman and Steiner developed what is now referred to as the “Dorfman-Steiner condition.”” Consider a firm with the following profit function, where per unit costs are constant in quantity (q) and increasing in quality (z), and \\(F\\) denotes fixed costs \\[\\pi = q(p,z) \\times (p-c-d\\times z) - F.\\] The first order conditions with respect to price and quality are \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d \\pi}{d p} &= \\frac{d q}{d p} (p-c-dz) + q = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{d \\pi}{d z} &= \\frac{d q}{d z} (p-c-dz) - dq = 0\n\\end{align*}\\] We can rewrite the first order condition for price as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\np &= \\frac{-q}{\\frac{d q}{d p}} + c + dz \\\\\n  &= \\frac{p}{\\epsilon_{p}} + c + dz \\\\\np \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{p}}\\right) &= c + dz \\\\\np &= \\frac{\\epsilon_{p}}{\\epsilon_{p}-1} (c+dz)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can similarly rewrite the first order condition for quality: \\[\\begin{align*}\ndz &= -\\frac{dq}{\\frac{d q}{d z}} + p - c \\\\\n  z &= -\\frac{q}{\\frac{d q}{d z}} + \\frac{p-c}{d} \\\\\n    &= -\\frac{z}{\\epsilon_{z}} + \\frac{p-c}{d} \\\\\n  z &= \\frac{\\epsilon_{z}}{\\epsilon_{z}+1} \\frac{p-c}{d}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can also rewrite these expressions in terms of \\(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{z}}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{p}}\\). In this case, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{p}} &= \\frac{p-c-dz)}{p} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{z}} &= \\frac{dz}{p - c - dz}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTaking the ratio of these terms and solving for \\(z\\) yields, \\[z = \\frac{p}{d}\\times \\frac{\\epsilon_{z}}{\\epsilon_{p}},\\] which is the Dorfman-Steiner condition. This condition predicts that quality will increase if the quality elasticity increases or if price increases. Similarly, quality increases if the price elasticity decreases or the marginal cost of quality decreases. This and similar conditions, although possibly oversimplified and reliant on strong assumptions, may help guide empirical work and provide possible predictions in the case of policies not yet observed in practice. For example, imagine that health insurers increase their cost sharing such that consumers are now faced with a larger portion of their marginal healthcare costs. This will tend to increase demand elasticity and therefore potentially reduce quality. This is in fact what we saw when managed care first became heavily adopted in private insurance markets in the 90s.\nPerhaps more interestingly, the Dorfman-Steiner condition has some interesting predictions as to the effect of competition on quality. Essentially, these effects are interdependent. If more competition has a large effect in terms of price elasticity (i.e., consumers are heavily responsive to the price effects from increased competition), then quality may decrease. If instead competition has a large effect in terms of quality elasticity (i.e., consumers are more responsive to quality changes), then quality will increase.\nBut what do we mean by “quality?” In an equation, it’s easy to imagine some metric that captures better quality, but how do we capture that in practice? Is it possible that competition may increase some notion of quality but not necessarily the measure of quality that we want? For example, perhaps competition would increase the most observable measures of quality and decrease less observable measures of quality?"

    "section": "17.2 Empirical Studies of Competition",
    "text": "17.2 Empirical Studies of Competition\n\n17.2.1 Competition with Fixed Prices\nKessler and McClellan (2000) adopt a “structure-conduct-performance” approach, but are careful to consider the endogeneity of their concentration measure. The authors analyze the effects of hospital competitiveness among Medicare beneficiaries with cardiac illness from 1985 through 1994. They measure competition using a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is a standard measure of market competition calculated as the sum of square market shares. Denoting firms by \\(i\\) and markets by \\(k\\), with \\(N_{k}\\) firms operating in market \\(k\\), the HHI is then calculated as: \\(HHI_{k}=\\sum_{i \\in k}^{N_{k}} s_{ik}^{2}.\\) Their outcomes of interest include mortality and cardiac complications.\nMarket shares are naturally endogenous in this setting. For example, areas with healthier patients and thus lower mortaility or lower complication rates may have fewer hospitals and thus more concentrated hospital markets. Alternatively, areas with very sick patients may lead to more hospitals entering the market and lower concentration. To account for this common empirical problem, the authors adopt a three-stage approach.\n\nEstimate a patient-level model of hospital choice as a function of patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and distance between patient residence and hospitals (with distance measured based on the midpoint of the relevant zipcodes). The authors measure distance on a characteristic-basis rather than on a hospital-basis. Specifically, the authors assume that all general/surgical hospitals within a 35 mile radius of a person’s zip code and all large hospitals within a 100 mile radius are part of the person’s choice set.\n\nThe authors separate hospitals in each person’s choice set based on “same-type” or “different-type” hospitals. For example, if hospital \\(j\\) is a teaching hospital, then the same-type hospitals (based on teaching hospital status) would be other teaching hospitals. The authors make this same-type versus different-type distinction for each of \\(H\\) different hospital characteristics (teaching status, a categorical measure of hospital bed size, and private or public ownership status). Each patient-hospital pair is therefore assigned \\(2\\times H\\) measures of distance (one for each characteristic, separately for same-type versus different-type hospitals). Specifically, \\(D_{ij}^{h+}\\) denotes the distance between person \\(i\\)’s residence and hospital \\(j\\) minus the distance between person \\(i\\)’s residence and the nearest alternative hospital with the same characteristic. \\(D_{ij}^{h-}\\) then denotes the distance between person \\(i\\)’s residence and hospital \\(j\\) minus the distance between person \\(i\\)’s residence and the nearest alternative hospital with a different characteristic.\nThe authors then categorize each calculated distance (\\(D_{ij}^{h+}\\) and \\(D_{ij}^{h-}\\), for all \\(h\\)) based on the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentile of the distribution for each measure. As such, hospital characteristics in each patient’s choice set are quantified based on the relative distance (by percentile category) to same-type and different-type competing hospitals. Denoting the \\(4 \\times 1\\) vector of distances by \\(DD_{ij}^{h+}\\) and \\(DD_{ij}^{h-}\\) and denoting indicators for hospital characteristics by \\(Z_{j}^{h}\\), the authors calculate an overall “distance” measure as \\[V_{ij}=\\sum_{h=1}^{H} DD_{ij}^{h+} \\left(\\theta_{1}^{h}Z_{j}^{h} + \\theta_{2}^{h}(1-Z_{j}^{h}) \\right) + D_{ij}^{h-}\\left( \\theta_{3}^{h}Z_{j}^{h} + \\theta_{4}^{h}(1-Z_{j}^{h}) \\right).\\] The authors also incorporate personal demographic characteristics, \\(X_{i}\\), through the interaction with \\(Z_{j}^{h}\\) as follows: \\[W_{ij} = \\sum_{h=1}^{H} X_{i} Z_{j}^{h} \\lambda_{h}.\\]\nAssuming a type I extreme value distribution for the error term, the probability of person \\(i\\) choosing hospital \\(j\\) can be written as: \\[\\pi_{ij} = Pr(Y_{ij}=1) = \\frac{\\exp{V_{ij} + W_{ij}}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{J} \\exp{V_{il} + W_{il}}}.\\]\n\nWith parameter estimates, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\lambda}\\) from step 1, the authors estimate the probability of patient \\(i\\) selecting each hospital \\(j\\) in their choice set, \\(\\hat{\\pi}_{ij}\\). From this, they estimate hospital market shares \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_{jk}\\) for each resident’s zip code, \\(k=1,...,K\\), \\[\\hat{\\alpha}_{jk} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in k} \\hat{\\pi}_{ij}}{\\sum_{j} \\sum_{i \\in k} \\hat{\\pi}_{ij}}.\\] The predicted market shares then form a predicted HHI for patients in zip code \\(k\\), \\[HHI_{k}^{pat} = \\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\hat{\\alpha}_{jk}^{2}.\\]\n\nThe authors next form a weighted average of the \\(HHI_{k}^{pat}\\) across the \\(k\\) zip codes for which the hospital receives patients. Specifically, denote by \\(\\beta_{kj}\\) the share of hospital \\(j\\)’s patients coming from zip code \\(k\\), then the hospital \\(HHI\\) is \\[\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\hat{\\beta}_{kj} HHI_{k}^{pat}.\\] Finally, since the authors examine patient level outcomes, they re-weight the hospital-level HHI by \\(\\alpha_{jk}\\) (for all \\(J\\) hospitals in the patient’s zip code).\n\nWith a measure of competitiveness, the authors regress patient outcomes and hospital expenditures on HHI, patient characteristics, other market characteristics such as the size of the patient’s MSA and market-level hospital characteristics, as well as zip code and time fixed effects.\n\nUltimately, the authors find that more competition reduces expenditures in later years and increases expenditures in earlier years, consistent with the medical arms race hypothesis discussed above. They also find that competition in later years was welfare improving, with the largest changes in welfare deriving from movements out of the most competitive quartile of concentration or into the least competitive quartile, particularly among markets with more managed care penetration. Meanwhile, movements in the middle quartiles appear to have no significant welfare effects. These findings therefore imply that competition is important, but that the effects of competition are not homogeneous. This begs the question, “how much competition is enough?”\n\n\n17.2.2 Empirical Studies of Competition with Market Prices\nTheory therefore tells us that hospital competition may reduce social welfare as follows. If there is weak price competition (e.g., consumers are unresponsive to price changes), then increased competition in non-price attributes may generate a medical arms race with hospitals quickly acquiring expensive technologies and passing these costs on to consumers (see Chapter 15 in Feldstein (2007)).1 To the extent that the marginal benefits from these new technologies or improvements in non-price attributes are lower than the marginal costs, then competition is socially wasteful. However, in a managed care environment, insurance companies can more strongly negotiate prices on behalf of consumers, effectively introducing a form of price competition and avoiding many of the medical arms race concerns.\nBut even in a managed care environment, we saw in our models of monopolistic competition that increased competition may be good or bad for differentiated product markets, potentially generating less efficient levels of care. Intuitively, a competitive market may underprovide variety because the firms cannot sufficiently capitalize on the differentiated product (i.e., the firm can’t capture any of the additional consumer surplus created). However, a competitive market may overprovide variety as well since the firms engage in business stealing. With entry costs, firms then capture less demand than expected (but still incur the cost of entry) and the additional consumer benefits from more variety may be more than offset by the entry costs. Importantly, this does not mean that consumers are worse off. Consumers are always better (or no worse) with increasing competition, but social welfare may be lower.\nAll that said, U.S. policies to improve or maintain competitiveness generally only consider a short-run time frame. If we consider quality as fixed, then increased competition is always welfare improving. But over the long run, it is theoretically ambiguous as to whether we want more healthcare providers or less. Incorporating other features of healthcare delivery further obfuscate the benefits of increased competition. For example, for patients with chronic conditions, coordination is an important part of high quality care, but integrated systems are arguably better at providing this coordination. Conversely, in a bargaining context, a larger hospital is able to negotiate a higher price. For these reasons, the effects of increased competition on hospital quality and price are empirical questions.\nIn general, empirical studies based on data prior to Medicare prospective payments and prior to the growth of managed care plans found that increased competition led to higher prices and higher hospital costs. This is consistent with the medical arms race hypothesis. Studies based on more recent data find the opposite, with increased competition leading to lower prices. Results on quality are less clear. In this section, we’ll discuss the details of a handful of papers in this area.\n\n\n17.2.3 Abraham, Gaynor, & Vogt (2007)\nAbraham, Gaynor, and Vogt (2007) study competitiveness in hospital markets via an entry-threshold approach, extending the initial analysis of Bresnahan and Reiss (1991). The idea is that firms will only enter a market if they expect to be profitable, and this only happens if there are enough customers to support the firm in a given market. One of the goals of this analysis is to gauge the extent to which a new entrant increases the competitiveness of local hospital markets. The authors therefore help identify an “appropriate” level of hospital competition. The authors’ analysis proceeds as follows:\n\nDenote the \\(N\\)th firm’s profit by: \\[\\Pi_{N}=V_{N}\\frac{S_{N}}{N}d_{N} - F_{N},\\] where \\(V_{N}\\) denotes the variable profit, \\(N\\) denotes the total number of firms, \\(S_{N}\\) denotes the number of consumers, \\(d_{N}\\) denotes per-capita demand, and \\(F_{N}\\) denotes fixed costs.\nFirms enter if it is profitable to do so, \\(\\Pi_{N}\\geq 0\\). The minimum number of consumers to support the \\(N\\)th firm is therefore the \\(S_{N}\\) where \\(\\Pi_{N}=0\\), which is \\[S_{N}=\\frac{F_{N}\\times N}{V_{N}\\times d_{N}}.\\]\nThe authors then gauge the toughness of competition by changes in \\(S_{N}\\) as \\(N\\) increases. \\(S_{N+1}&gt;S_{N}\\) implies the \\((N+1)\\)th firm requires more consumers in the market to be profitable relative to the \\(N\\)th firm, which necessarily implies that margins must be lower for the \\((N+1)\\)th firm and therefore competition is “tougher.”\nBased on the assumed profit function, the authors specify conditional mean functions for \\(S_{N}\\), \\(d_{N}\\), \\(V_{N}\\), and \\(F_{N}\\) as functions of observable characteristics: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  S_{N} &= \\exp \\left(Y\\lambda + \\varepsilon_{S}\\right) \\\\\n  d_{N} &= \\exp \\left(X\\delta_{X} + W\\delta_{W} + \\delta_{N} + \\varepsilon_{d}\\right) \\\\\n  V_{N} &= \\exp \\left(X\\alpha_{X} + W\\alpha_{W} - \\delta_{N} + \\varepsilon_{V}\\right) \\\\\n  F_{N} &= \\exp \\left(W\\gamma_{W} + \\gamma_{N} + \\varepsilon_{F}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] This yields a reduced form expression, \\[\\ln \\Pi_{N}=Y\\lambda + X(\\delta_{X}+\\alpha_{X}) + W(\\delta_{W}+\\alpha_{W}-\\gamma_{W}) + \\delta_{N} - \\alpha_{N} - \\gamma_{N} - \\ln N + \\varepsilon_{S} + \\varepsilon_{d} + \\varepsilon_{V} - \\varepsilon_{F},\\] the parameters of which are estimated using an ordered probit model with the number of hospitals as the outcome (based on the assumption that \\(N\\) firms exist when \\(\\Pi_{N}\\geq 0\\) and \\(\\Pi_{N+1} &lt; 0\\)). They transform the number of hospitals into an ordered variable with 5 potential values, 0, 1, 2, 3, and \\(4+\\).\n\nThey also specify a second conditional mean function for quantity, \\(Q_{N}=S_{N}d_{N}\\). The authors estimate these two equations with maximum likelihood using two exclusion restrictions along with a discrete factor approximation to allow correlation in the residuals of the quantity and profit specifications.\nThe results suggest that competition significantly toughens with new hospitals in the market, up to 4 hospitals. Beyond that point, additional hospitals may steal customers but do not reduce variable profits and therefore do not significantly change the amount of competitiveness (Table VIII in paper).\n\n\n17.2.4 Empirical Analysis of Hospital Mergers\nA natural approach to examining the effect of competition on prices, health outcomes, etc. is to look directly at hospitals or markets where a reduction in competition has taken place (e.g., due to a merger, acquisition, or a hospital closure). This has become a popular empirical approach recently, with numerous studies examining the effects of mergers on hospital pricing and quality of care. Since all of these papers take the same basic approach, we’ll focus here on summarizing the literature’s primary findings in this area. See Vogt and Town (2006) for a nice survey on this literature.\nFirst, note that hospital markets have become increasingly consolidated over time. For example, we saw 100 hospital mergers in 2012 and 90 in 2011, compared to just 74 total from 1983 to 1988. A common way of measuring concentration in an industry is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). This is calculated as the sum of squared market shares. In 1987, the mean hospital HHI was 2,340, but by 2006, this increased to 3,161.2 Similarly, in 1990, approximately 65% of MSAs were classified as “highly concentrated” according to the Federal Trade Commission’s threshold HHI of 2,500. And by 2006, more than 77% of MSAs were highly concentrated. Conversely, the percentage of unconcentrated MSAs (HHI \\(&lt;\\) 1,800) fell from 23% in 1990 to 11% in 2006.\nOne natural question is why we’ve seen such a growth in merger activity. For example, it could be due to technological advances leaving hospitals with significant excess capacity and need for consolidation. It could also be due to pressure from insurers and managed care; however, there is little empirical evidence that M&A activity is due to increased managed care, although there is strong anecdotal evidence that hospitals may pursue mergers due to fear of managed care presence and negotiating power.\nAnother question concerns the impact of mergers on patients (prices and quality of care). Here, increased merger activity and hospital consolidation need not be theoretically bad for consumers. Hospitals could be providing more coordinated care and ultimately reducing healthcare utilization, as well as the standard argument in favor of mergers – efficiency gains. Unfortunately, empirical studies consistently find an increase in price following hospital consolidation, with increases of 40% or more when consolidation occurs among nearby hospitals. This is an increase in rival firm prices, as theory would predict an increase in own-firm and rival-firm prices (overall market increase) following increases in consolidation. Consolidation reduce hospital costs (when facilities are combined), but effects on prices suggest that the cost savings are not passed on to customers. Regarding quality, the empirical evidence is somewhat mixed, generally pointing to slight quality reductions following increases in consolidation."

    "text": "17.3 Vertical Integration between Physicians and Hospitals\nThe share of physician practices owned by hospitals more than doubled from 2002 to 2008 and continues to increase. Moreover, hospital employment of physicians is now much more common than it was even just 10 years ago. Proponents of such increased vertical alignment between physicians and hospitals cite increases in quality and efficiency resulting from alignment. This is essentially a standard transactions cost argument, wherein vertical integration allows the firm to exploit economies of scale and improve efficiency. However, concerns of hospital-physician alignment include an increase in prices, a bundling of services within a given hospital-physician network (increasing excess care), and a reduction in referral options for competitors (hence reducing choice). Physician control over care has natural implications for vertical integration, as it reveals one of at least two primary incentives for a hospital to more closely align with physicians."

    "section": "17.4 Measuring Competition and Market Power",
    "text": "17.4 Measuring Competition and Market Power\nCapps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003) attempts to derive a theoretically-backed measure of market power in what the authors call “option demand markets.”” Such a market is simply one where an intermediary sells a network of suppliers/manufacturers to consumers, and where consumers are uncertain about the final services/products they will need. The authors have in mind hospital markets in which insurers group hospitals into a network (i.e., managed care insurers), but the concept extends to other markets as well. The key aspect of this type of market is that consumers agree to restrict their choice set before they know the goods or services that they may need to purchase. The authors are ultimately interested in estimating a consumer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a given supplier to be included in the intermediary’s network.\nTo form their estimated WTP, the authors work backwards, starting with an estimate of utility of care received at hospital \\(j\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\nU_{ij} &= \\alpha R_{j} + H_{j}'\\Gamma X_{i} + \\tau_{1} T_{ij} + \\tau_{2} T_{ij} X_{i} + \\tau_{3} T_{ij} R_{j} - \\gamma(Y_{i},Z_{i}) P_{j}(Z_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n&= U(H_{j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) - \\gamma(X_{i})P_{j}(Z_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{ij},\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(H_{j}=[R_{j},S_{j}]\\) is a vector of hospital characteristics split between characteristics common across all patients (\\(R_{j}\\)) and condition-specific characteristics (\\(S_{j}\\)), \\(X_{i}=[Y_{i},Z_{i}]\\) is similarly a vector of patient characteristics consisting of demographics (\\(Y_{i}\\)) and clinical attributes (\\(Z_{i}\\)). \\(P_{j}(Z_{i})\\) is the out-of-pocket price to be paid based on the patient’s clinical needs (i.e., diagnosis), \\(\\lambda_{i}\\) denotes the household’s geographic location, with \\(T_{ij}=T_{j}(\\lambda_{i})\\) reflecting travel time from the patient’s residence zip code to hospital \\(j\\).\nAssuming that out-of-pocket costs are essentially identical across hospitals in the patient’s network, then patient \\(i\\) will select hospital \\(j\\) if, for all \\(k \\neq j\\), \\[U(H_{j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) - U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) &gt; \\varepsilon_{ik} - \\varepsilon_{ij}.\\] With appropriate assumptions on the error terms, the probability that patient \\(i\\) selects hospital \\(j\\), \\(s_{ij}\\), is given by \\[s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\frac{\\text{exp}(U(H_{j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}))}{\\sum_{g\\in G}\\text{exp}(U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}))}.\\] With this choice probability, we can easily estimate the parameters of the utility function using maximum likelihood techniques.\nTaking the utility as given, we now need to work backwards to determine the expected utility from having access to a given network, \\(G\\). With \\(U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\) as given, and allowing for an independently distributed standard extreme value error, \\(\\varepsilon_{g}\\), then the expected maximum utility across all \\(g\\) hospitals is given as \\[V(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\text{E} \\left[\\max_{g\\in G} U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) + \\varepsilon_{g} \\right] = \\text{ln} \\left[\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) \\right].\\] Hospital \\(j\\)’s contribution to this expected maximum is simply the difference between the expected maximum with and without hospital \\(j\\) included in the choice set, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\triangle V_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) &= V(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) - V(G_{-j},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}) \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) \\right] - \\text{ln} \\left[\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} \\text{exp} (U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) \\right] \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }{\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} \\text{exp} (U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i}))} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} \\text{exp} (U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }{\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }\\right)^{-1} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} \\frac{ \\text{exp} (U(H_{k},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }{\\sum_{g\\in G} \\text{exp} (U(H_{g},X_{i},\\lambda_{i})) }\\right)^{-1} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{k\\in G_{-j}} s_{k}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\right)^{-1} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\text{ln} \\left[ \\left( 1- s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\right)^{-1} \\right].\n\\end{align*}\\] We can then translate \\(\\triangle V_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\) into dollar values by weighting by the marginal utility of price, such that the interim willingness to pay is \\[\\triangle \\tilde{W}_{j} = \\frac{\\triangle V_{j}}{\\gamma (X_{i})}.\\]\nFinally, we need to work backwards one more step to estimate the WTP to include hospital \\(j\\) in patient \\(i\\)’s network. This simply amounts to taking the integral of \\(\\tilde{W}_{j}\\) over all possible health conditions, \\(Z_{i}\\), \\[W_{ij}(G,Y_{i},\\lambda_{i}) = \\int_{Z} \\frac{\\delta V_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})}{\\gamma (X_{i})} f(Z_{i}|Y_{i},\\lambda_{i}) dZ_{i}.\\] Further integrating over all patients, \\((Y_{i},\\lambda_{i})\\), yields \\[WTP_{j} = N \\int_{\\lambda} \\int_{Z} \\int_{Y} \\frac{1}{\\gamma (X_{i})} \\text{ln}\\left[\\frac{1}{1-s_{j}(G,X_{i},\\lambda_{i})} \\right]f(Y_{i},Z_{i},\\lambda_{i})dY_{i} dZ_{i} d\\lambda_{i}.\\]"

We then introduce the idea of physician agency and explain how asymmetric information and differential incentives may introduce some divergence between a patient’s ideal health care consumption versus the observed amount of health care delivered. This is the subject of Chapter 8. Next, in Chapter 9, we discuss how different payment models may influence the extent and direction of such a divergence, focusing on the extreme cases of fee-for-service payments versus fully capitated payments. Finally, we discuss three other major determinants of physician practice patterns — learning and practice environment, the latter of which we discuss in the context of physician training and location.

Physicians, nurses, hospitals, prescription drugs, rehabilitation services, long-term care services, and ancillary services like laboratories and imaging centers collectively form the diverse landscape of healthcare. Among these, physicians play a particularly influential role as they have a significant impact on various aspects of healthcare delivery.\nPhysician training and interactions are crucial factors that shape healthcare practices. Training, residency, and fellowship programs can influence the future practice styles of physicians. Additionally, the distinction between primary care and specialists, as well as referrals within and across different types of physicians, significantly impact the dynamics of healthcare interactions.\nPhysicians can also have different organizational affiliations, which further shape their practice environments. Some physicians are self-employed, managing their own practices, while others are part of larger group practices. There are also physicians who are vertically integrated with hospitals or insurers, establishing closer ties with these entities.\nMany treatments also involve some interaction between a physician and a hospital. Here, the healthcare landscape encompasses various types of hospitals catering to different needs. These include general acute-care hospitals for short-term treatments, rehabilitation hospitals, specialty hospitals such as Children’s hospitals, orthopedic, cardiac, and cancer centers, long-term care hospitals, as well as stand-alone surgery centers and emergency departments. The distinction between inpatient and outpatient services adds to the diversity of healthcare facilities.\nOwnership type is another significant aspect within healthcare. Hospitals and healthcare organizations can have different ownership structures, such as government-owned or assisted, private not-for-profit, private for-profit, or even private equity ownership. These ownership models can impact the functioning and characteristics of healthcare institutions."

They serve as the entry point into the healthcare system for most patients, including in emergency departments. Primary care physicians refer patients to specialists and ancillary services. Specialists, in turn, refer patients to other specialists and ancillary services, and may make decisions regarding the location of surgeries if required. Specialists or hospitalists also play a role in referring patients to follow-up care after inpatient stays. Moreover, physicians of all types are involved in selecting appropriate medications for patients.\nPhysicians possess more information and knowledge compared to patients, granting them a higher level of influence over healthcare decisions. This concept, known as physician agency, refers to physicians acting as “agents” making or suggesting healthcare decisions on behalf of their patients. A crucial empirical question is therefore when and if these decisions align with what patients would have chosen themselves."

    "text": "7.3 Variation in Health Care Utilization\nPhysician agency has consequences that affect healthcare utilization and patient experiences. Patients may face information frictions or financial incentives influenced by physicians. The type of care individuals receive can depend on the preferences and practices of their physicians, leading to significant variation in healthcare utilization and spending across different markets and even within the same market. Understanding and addressing this variation is crucial for optimizing healthcare outcomes. The potential for physician influence on health care variation is exemplified in a recent report from the National Institute for Health Care Management, Is Health Care Shoppable?\nConsidering the impact of physician agency on healthcare spending, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care provides several ways of visualizing healthcare variation across different regions. As shown in Figure 7.1, the U.S. experiences significant variation in health care utilization across different geographic areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Map of U.S. Medicare Spending per Beneficiary\n\n\nThe extent of this variation is perhaps better illustrated with a plot of per-beneficiary spending, as in Figure 7.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Plot of U.S. Medicare Spending per Beneficiary\n\n\nWhen examining healthcare variation, the concept of waste in healthcare comes into focus. Estimates suggest that more than 30% of healthcare expenditures are considered “wasteful.” Examples of waste include payment differentials based on the location of treatment, overutilization of certain imaging techniques with limited benefit, inappropriate use of proton treatment for certain conditions, unnecessary placement of heart stents in specific patient populations, and the performance of arthroscopic knee surgery where other treatment options may be more suitable.\nHowever, identifying waste in healthcare is challenging, as many assessments are retrospective. It is difficult to pinpoint waste in advance. Nevertheless, it is important to explore strategies to reduce waste and optimize resource allocation in healthcare, taking into account the complexities of physician agency and the dynamic nature of healthcare decision-making."

The question of financial incentives and physician treatment decisions is particularly important as we consider different types of payment models, such as fee-for-service payments or capitated payments. For now, let’s forgot about these things and just think about a basic model of treatment decisions in which we assume physicians care both about patient benefit and profit. We’ll consider two versions of this model: one in which the physician can set both the price and the quantity of care, and another in which prices are fixed (e.g., by a large public insurance option)."

    "text": "8.2 With price and quantity setting power\nSetup\nIn this analysis, we establish the fundamental elements of the model for physician services. Let’s denote the quantity of physician services as \\(x\\), while the benefit derived by patients from these services is represented as \\(B(x)\\). Patients are required to pay a price of \\(p\\) for each unit of service, and the payment is received by the physicians. Simultaneously, physicians incur a cost of \\(c\\) for each unit of care they provide.\nTo understand the net benefit to patients, we use the formula \\(NB(x) = B(x) - px\\), which takes into account the benefit received minus the price paid. Moreover, physicians must make a crucial decision by choosing the quantity of care they provide. This decision must be such that the net benefit to patients, \\(NB(x) = B(x) - px\\), is greater than or equal to the patient’s outside option, denoted as \\(NB^{0}\\).\nSolving the Model\nHaving established the model’s framework, we now seek to determine the optimal quantity of care that will be provided by physicians, which we represent as \\(x\\). This requires solving the model in two distinct steps:\n\nFirst, physicians aim to provide a minimum surplus that satisfies the patient’s preferences and keeps them in the medical care process. This surplus is reflected in Equation 8.1.\n\n\\[NB(x) = B(x) - px = NB^{0} \\tag{8.1}\\]\n\nSubsequently, we proceed by substituting the value of \\(x\\) obtained in the previous step into the physician’s profit function:\n\n\\[\\pi = (p-c)x = B(x) - NB^{0} - cx. \\tag{8.2}\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\) allows us to determine the optimal quantity of care that physicians should provide to maximize their profits while satisfying the patient’s requirements.\nEven in this very general setup, we can begin to solve the model and make some theoretical predictions about quantity of care in this environment. Solving the physician’s objective function in Equation 8.2 yields \\(\\frac{d B(x)}{x} - c =0\\). In other words, the physician sets quantity of care so that the marginal benefit of care to the patient is equal to the physician’s marginal cost. Not a revolutionary finding, but important when we compare this to the patient’s optimum. If the patient could choose \\(x\\) independently, they would aim to maximize their net benefit in Equation 8.1 such that \\(\\frac{ d B(x)}{x} - p =0\\). So the patient would set marginal benefit equal to the price of care. Of course, the price of care \\(p\\) is the marginal cost to the patient, so both the physician and patient set marginal benefit equal to marginal cost, but they have different marginal costs and therefore different optimal choices of \\(x\\).\nSince we’ve assumed that \\(B'(x)\\) is decreasing, and since it must be the case that \\(p&gt;c\\) (otherwise the physician would make no positive profit), it follows that the physician’s optimal choice of \\(x\\) exceeds that of the patient’s. This is because \\(B'(x)=c\\) occurs at a point further out on the x-axis than \\(B'(x)=p\\). This is depicted graphically in Figure 8.1. This simple model therefore helps us understand how financial incentives, costs, and patient preferences collectively influence the decision-making process of physicians, ultimately impacting the quantity of care delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Depiction of physician agency"

    "section": "8.3 With fixed prices",
    "text": "8.3 With fixed prices\nThe two-step approach is applicable when both prices and the quantity of care are variable. However, when physicians cannot set prices (e.g., prices are fixed administratively at a certain level), we work solely based on the patient’s net benefit constraint. The constraint is still given by \\(B(x) - \\bar{p}x = NB^{0}\\), but we replace \\(p\\) with \\(\\bar{p}\\) to denote the fixed price. \\(NB^{0}\\) still denotes the patient’s outside option.\nWhy can’t we replace the net benefit constraint into the physician’s maximization problem? This is a corner solution, so standard derivatives aren’t going to work here. Instead, we rely on the patient’s net benefit constraint to find the optimal quantity of care. We therefore obtain the solution simply by rewriting the constraint, so that\n\\[x= \\frac{B(x) - NB^{0}}{\\bar{p}}. \\tag{8.3}\\]\nHow does \\(x\\) change if \\(p\\) changes? To answer this, we can totally differentiate Equation 8.3:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nb(x)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}p} - x - p\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}p} &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{-x}{p-b(x)} &&lt; 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSo there is a negative relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(\\bar{p}\\). This means that, when the administratively set price (\\(p\\)) increases, we observe a decrease in the quantity of services provided. Conversely, if the price decreases, the quantity of services provided increases. Understanding the relationship between administrative price changes and healthcare utilization is crucial for policy considerations. If we aim to reduce healthcare utilization or spending, attempting to do so solely by cutting payments might not be effective. The comparative statics analysis demonstrates that changes in administratively set prices have direct implications for the quantity of services provided by physicians."

    "text": "9.1 Defining FFS and Capitated Payments\nFor our purposes, FFS payments simply consist of separate payments for each service, creating a system where more care leads to more revenue. This is how we envisioned payments in the model in the prior chapter. And with some slight adjustments, this is also how traditional Medicare pays for health care among its beneficiaries.\nIn contrast, capitated payments provide a fixed amount intended to cover all expenses for a specific person or group, presenting a financial risk for healthcare providers. If actual expenses exceed the allocated amount, providers experience potential losses, while keeping costs below the capitated payment leads to profitability. The Kaiser system is probably the best example of a totally capitated payment system in the U.S. It’s a private health insurance plan with an associated network of providers. Only people enrolled in the Kaiser insurance plan have access to the Kaiser providers, so it’s a closed system of insurance and providers. Accountable Care Organizations are also similar to a fully capitated model, although not exactly since ACOs are voluntary.\nThe differences between FFS and capitated payments create distinct incentives for healthcare providers. In the FFS model, the primary incentive is to maximize revenue by delivering more services, potentially leading to overutilization and unnecessary treatments. On the other hand, capitated payments incentivize providers to be more prudent in their service delivery to avoid financial losses, potentially leading to underprovision of care."

    "text": "9.2 FFS and Capitated Payments in Physician Agency\nTo see this more formally, let’s set up a new version of our agency model. Physicians receive a fixed amount per patient, denoted \\(R\\), along with a price per unit of service, \\(p_{s}\\). Given the choice of quantity of care, \\(x\\), (assumed to be the same for each patient) physicians receive \\(R + (p_{s} - c)x\\) for each patient. Finally, the number of patients for each physician is expressed as a positive function of the net benefit offered, \\(n(NB)\\), where \\(NB=B(x) - p_{d}x\\). Here, we’re also allowing separate prices paid by the patient versus prices received by the provider, where the patient pays \\(p_{d}\\) and the physician receives \\(p_{s}\\). We also assume that the physician has no control over prices. They can only affect the amount of care, \\(x\\).\nPhysician’s again aim to maximize profits by optimizing the profit function, \\(\\pi=n(NB)\\left[R+(p_{s}-c)x\\right]\\). This maximization problems yields the following first order condition:\n\\[n'(NB)(B'(x) - p_{d}) \\left[R + (p_{s} - c)x \\right] + n(NB)(p_{s}-c) = 0.\\]\nRearranging terms and multiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{1}{NB}\\), we get: \\[\\frac{B'(x) - p_{d}}{NB} \\frac{R + (p_{s} - c)x}{p_{s}-c} = - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{n,NB}}. \\tag{9.1}\\]\nEven without any specific assumptions on the benefit function, we can begin to say something about the physician’s selection of \\(x\\) relative to the patient’s own optimal \\(x\\) under different payment scenarios. For example, assume that \\(R=0\\) and \\(p_{s}&gt;c\\), so that there is no capitated payment and the physician is reimbursed entirely on a FFS basis. In that case, the second term on the left hand side of Equation 9.1 must be positive. Since we know the product on the left hand side must be negative (to match the sign of the right hand side), then it follows that \\(B'(x) - p_{d}&lt;0\\). Since we also know that the patient would optimally set \\(B'(x)=p_{d}\\), then the case of \\(R=0\\) and \\(p_{s}&gt;c\\) must be such that the physician overtreats relative to the patient’s optimal. That’s the only way for \\(B'(x)&lt;p_{d}\\).\nAlternatively, let’s consider the case of \\(R&gt;0\\) with \\(p_{s}&lt;c\\), so that the physician now earns a set amount of money per patient but loses money on each unit of care. In a purely capitated model, we would set \\(p_{s}=0&lt;c\\). Imposing these constraints onto Equation 9.1, note that the second half of the left hand side is now negative since \\(p_{s}-c&lt;0\\) (assuming \\(R-(p_{s} -c)x&gt;0\\), which is necessary in order for the physician to stay in the market anyway). This means that the first part of the left hand side must be positive (i.e., \\(B'(x)&gt;p_{d}\\)), so that physicians now undertreat relative to the patient’s optimal."

The Kaiser system is one example in the private insurance market. In the public insurance market, the closest examples of capitated payments are probably Bundled Payments and Accountable Care Organizations. Apart from capitation, Pay for Performance (P4P) programs are also employed in Medicare to incentivize quality care and positive patient outcomes. These programs include the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, Value-based Purchasing, and the Quality Payment Program for physicians, each encouraging high-quality care and improved patient experiences through various metrics and financial incentives. The goal of such P4P programs is partly to counter the wedge between physician and patient optimal care introduced by the incentives from the underlying payment models."

The important point here is simply that, in real life, physicians are often choosing between different treatment options rather than some easily measured “quantity.” In this sense, the empirical literature has consistently found significant and meaningful physician responses to financial incentives, including effects on treatment patterns (Clemens and Gottlieb (2014)), discharge patterns (Einav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney (2023), Einav, Finkelstein, and Mahoney (2018), and Eliason et al. (2018)), the types of patients seen (Cabral, Carey, and Miller (2021)), as well as location of care (Munnich et al. (2021) and Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler (2016)). Financial incentives also spillover across insurance types, where changes in payments from one insurer can influence how other types of patients are treated (Barnett, Olenski, and Sacarny (2023)). The takeaway from all this is that, on the margin, financial incentives do affect treatment decisions. Thankfully, there is less evidence that such responses decrease quality of care."

    "text": "10.1 Motivation\nPhysicians, positioned at the forefront of medical decision-making, wield considerable discretion in determining the treatments administered to patients. The subsequent variation in healthcare practices, resulting from these decisions, echoes across different contexts and markets. This variation is propelled by several factors, including differences in information availability, personal beliefs, and financial incentives, contributing to a diverse landscape of healthcare utilization.\nA critical facet contributing to this variation is the intrinsic asymmetry of information within the healthcare domain. Physicians, informed by varying degrees of experiential learning, training, and professional affiliations, often possess disparate levels of insight into treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. This inherent asymmetry results in divergent medical judgments and influences the care trajectory patients experience."

    "section": "10.2 Physician Learning",
    "text": "10.2 Physician Learning\nTo dissect the underpinnings of physician learning, Bayesian updating emerges as an insightful lens. This mathematical framework enables us to elucidate the dynamics that drive physicians’ evolving beliefs, providing a formal framework for understanding how new information influences medical decision-making.\nBayesian updating affords a systematic methodology for integrating prior beliefs with newly acquired data. The core of this framework lies in Bayes’ theorem, a fundamental principle in probability theory. By judiciously combining prior beliefs with observed evidence, physicians can iteratively refine their beliefs, culminating in posterior distributions that encapsulate updated knowledge.\n\n10.2.1 The Mechanics of Bayes’ Rule\nBayes’ rule formalizes the relationship between prior beliefs, likelihood functions, and observed data. This mechanism of assimilating data, while accommodating the idiosyncrasies of prior convictions, constitutes the crux of belief evolution. More formally, given prior beliefs about treatment quality, \\(P(\\theta\\)), and observed outcomes \\(y\\), the physician updates their belief on the quality of treatment using:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(\\theta|y) &= \\frac{P(y|\\theta) \\times P(\\theta)}{P(y)} \\\\\n& \\propto P(y|\\theta) \\times P(\\theta),\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(P(\\theta | y)\\) is the updated belief (posterior distribution) about the effectiveness of treatment after observing outcomes; \\(P(y | \\theta)\\) is probability of outcome \\(y\\) given the effectiveness \\(\\theta\\) (the likelihood); and \\(P(y)\\) is the marginal probability of patient outcome \\(y\\). We typically use the “proportional to” expression, \\(\\propto\\), to focus on relative probabilities and avoid complications from the normalization \\(P(y)\\), which can sometimes lead to unruly posterior distributions requiring numerical integration.\nFor some simple intuition in the context of physician learning, imagine a physician is considering a new treatment option for their patients. While they are unsure of the effectiveness of treatment, they have some initial belief about the treatment’s effectiveness captured by their prior, \\(P(\\theta)\\). As the physician treats patients and observes outcomes, they update their beliefs using Bayes’ rule.\nIn general, updating these beliefs mathematically will integration of the posterior distribution, which can be complicated; however, with specific assumptions, there are “closed-form” solutions to the posterior distribution. We call these “conjugate” distributions. For example, the beta distribution is the conjugate prior distribution for the Bernoulli distribution (among others). These are handy distributions to use in the context of physician learning, because the Beta distribution has support over the \\([0,1]\\) interval, and the Bernoulli distribution is a series of Binomial draws (e.g., several binary occurrences of whether the patient improved or not). So these are natural distributions to work with when considering the evolution of beliefs about the effectiveness of some treatment.\n\n\n10.2.2 Baye’s Rule with Beta Prior and Binomial Likelihood\nSince all of the examples we’ll talk about here involve a Beta prior and a Binomial likelihood, it’s worthwhile to derive the posterior explicitly for this case. The Beta distribution is governed by its “shape” parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n\\[P(θ) = \\frac{\\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1 - \\theta)^{\\beta-1} }{B(\\alpha, \\beta)},\\] where \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is a normalization constant to ensure the PDF integrates to 1. The mean and variance of the Beta distribution also have very easy formulas, with \\(\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}\\) and \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^{2} (\\alpha+ \\beta + 1)}\\).\nSimilarly, the Binomial outcome can be denoted by \\(y\\sim B(n,\\theta)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of trials and \\(\\theta\\) is the probability of success for any single case\n\\[ P(y|n, \\theta) = {n \\choose s} \\theta^{s} (1-\\theta)^{n-s}\\]\nOur goal is to derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) with prior, \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(\\alpha_{0}, \\beta_{0})\\), which is as follows: \\[\\begin{align}\nP(\\theta | y) &= \\frac{P(y| \\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(y)} \\\\\n& \\propto \\frac{ {n \\choose s} \\theta^{s} (1 - \\theta)^{n - s} \\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1 - \\theta)^{\\beta-1} } { B(\\alpha, \\beta) } \\\\\n& \\propto \\frac{ {n \\choose s} \\theta^{\\alpha+s-1} (1 - \\theta)^{\\beta+n-s-1} } { B(\\alpha, \\beta) } \\\\\n& \\propto B(\\alpha+s, \\beta + n - s)\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn this case, \\({n \\choose s}\\) and \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) are just normalization constants, so we can ignore them, and the expression reduces to a Beta distribution with shape parameters \\(\\alpha_{0}+s\\) and \\(\\beta_{0} + n - s\\). It’s useful to focus on a specific moment of the posterior distribution to see how it has evolved via Bayesian updating. Recalling the mean of the Beta distribution, the updated (posterior) mean is \\(\\mu_{1} = \\frac{\\alpha_{0}+s}{\\beta_{0} + n - s}\\). The extent to which the physician’s beliefs move more or less toward the observed data therefore depends on their priors."

    "text": "10.3 Some Examples\nTo contextualize things, let us delve into two illustrative cases that elucidate the potential role of physician learning in healthcare variation. Assume that physician’s have access to the same data in which 70 out of 100 patients showed improvement from a new treatment.\n\n10.3.1 Case 1: “Diffuse” Priors and Belief Convergence\nA “diffuse” prior can be reflected by a uniform distribution of beliefs in the the physician has no strong prior as to the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of treatment. We can reflect this formally with \\(Beta(\\alpha_{0}=1, \\beta_{0}=1)\\). Following the steps from the prior section, we know that the updated posterior distribution will also follow a Beta distribution with shape parameters \\(\\alpha_{1} = \\alpha_{0} + 70 = 71\\) and \\(\\beta_{1} = \\beta_{0} + 100 - 70 = 31\\). The posterior mean is then \\(\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\alpha_{1}+\\beta_{1}} = \\frac{71}{71+31} \\approx 0.6969\\). So the physician’s updated belief of the effectiveness of treatment almost exactly matches the observed effectiveness rate of 70%.\n\n\n10.3.2 Case 2: The Impact of “Strong” Priors\nIn contrast, consider a case in which the physician has very strong negative priors (e.g., they firmly believe that this new treatment is ineffective). We can capture this formally with \\(Beta(\\alpha_{0}=1, \\beta_{0}=20)\\). The posterior mean, again based on 70 successes out of 100 cases, is \\(\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}}{\\alpha_{1}+\\beta_{1}} = \\frac{71}{71+50} \\approx 0.5861\\). In this case, even though the physician had access to the same observational data, they place significantly less weight on those data and therefore remain more skeptical of the effectiveness of the treatment."

    "text": "11.2 Training\nOne source of such a difference is their medical training. This encompasses various aspects crucial to shaping the competencies and practices of medical professionals. These areas include medical education and the selection of specialization. The significance of these facets cannot be understated, as they collectively mold the approach and conduct of physicians in their practice. Medical education forms the foundation upon which physicians build their knowledge and skills. It involves a standardized curriculum that aims to provide a consistent level of training to medical students. This training equips future physicians with the requisite medical knowledge, diagnostic abilities, and clinical skills needed to effectively address patient needs. Selecting a specialization represents a critical juncture in a physician’s career path. The decision to pursue a particular specialty can significantly impact the trajectory of a physician’s practice. Specializations encompass distinct areas of medicine, each with its unique set of challenges, patient populations, and treatment paradigms.\nIn addition, while not a formal component of training, personal biases can play a subtle yet influential role in a physician’s practice. These biases, stemming from individual beliefs and experiences, can unconsciously affect diagnosis, treatment decisions, and patient interactions. Recognizing and addressing these biases is crucial to ensuring equitable and evidence-based healthcare delivery.\nSeveral studies shed light on the dynamics of physician training and its implications on practice patterns and patient outcomes. Chan (2021) delves into the team dynamics and influences that shape physicians’ practice during their residency. The study highlights the significance of collaborative decision-making and its impact on the development of treatment approaches. A recent working paper by Maximilian Pany and co-authors also explores the phenomenon of physicians adhering to treatment patterns of advisors during their residency. The study uncovers how mentorship and guidance during training can shape a physician’s approach to patient care, with implications for long-term practice habits. Similarly, Kravitz and Greenfield (1995) examine the training of primary care physicians (PCPs) and its association with healthcare utilization. The study suggests that PCPs’ training influences their practice patterns, potentially leading to more efficient healthcare resource allocation."

However, the applicability of peer effects to physicians’ treatment decisions remains an intriguing question.\nMolitor (2018) examines the extent to which physicians adopt the practice patterns of their peers when transitioning to new practices. Focusing on cardiologists, the study explores the role of practice environment in influencing treatment decisions and highlights the prevalence of peer effects in shaping physician behavior.\nMolitor’s study delves into the evolution of physician practice styles, particularly among cardiologists who migrate to new practices. The research emphasizes the substantial impact of the practice environment on physician behavior, accounting for a significant portion of the observed variation in practice patterns.\nA recent working paper from Badinski et al. offers a new study of geographic variation in healthcare utilization and its correlation with physician-related factors. The study consolidates prior approaches, revealing substantial heterogeneity across physician types. The findings suggest that for cardiologists, practice environment plays a central role in determining treatment patterns, overshadowing individual physician practice style. Conversely, for primary care physicians (PCPs), individual practice style gains prominence in explaining variations in healthcare utilization."

    "text": "11.4 Summary\nAddressing inefficiencies in healthcare delivery requires understanding the sources of variation in physician practice and its impact on healthcare utilization. The persistence of significant variations in healthcare utilization across different markets raises a pertinent concern. These variations cannot be solely attributed to patient need or variations in the quality of care provided. Rather, they point toward potential inefficiencies within healthcare systems.\nSeveral factors contribute to the observed inefficiencies in healthcare utilization. As physicians continuously learn and adapt to evolving medical knowledge, disparities in their access to information and varying learning curves can lead to disparate treatment decisions. The practice environment, including the influence of peers and colleagues, can contribute to the diffusion of specific treatment patterns. Peer effects may lead physicians to adopt practices that are popular within their professional networks. Furthermore, physician training and prior beliefs can inadvertently influence treatment decisions. Unconscious biases, rooted in individual experiences and training, may impact diagnoses and care plans.\nAddressing inefficiencies in physician practice patterns and healthcare utilization requires multifaceted solutions. Enhancing information transparency, through mechanisms such as FDA regulations and healthcare rating systems, can empower patients and providers to make more informed decisions. Integrating best practices, such as the use of checklists and electronic health records (EHRs), can standardize care processes and minimize variation. However, efforts to change practice patterns may encounter resistance from physicians accustomed to certain routines. Balancing the integration of new tools and approaches with physician preferences is a critical challenge.\nIn conclusion, understanding the dynamics of physician training, practice patterns, and their impact on healthcare utilization is paramount to addressing inefficiencies in healthcare systems. Through a combination of evidence-based policies and collaborative efforts, healthcare stakeholders can work towards achieving more consistent and efficient healthcare delivery."

Specifically, the U.S. ranks last among the 11 high-income countries analyzed in terms of health outcomes, with higher rates of mortality and morbidity from chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Additionally, the U.S. has the highest rate of mortality amenable to health care, suggesting that the health care system is not functioning optimally. The report also finds that the U.S. has the highest rate of adults who go without needed health care due to cost, with one-third of adults reporting cost-related access problems.\nStill, the U.S. excels in certain areas: cancer survival, treatment of cardiovascular disease, and medical innovation. Our system is capable of world-leading care, but it delivers it unevenly. The coexistence of excellence and underperformance reflects deep inequities in access and use of care.",

On the one hand, per capita spending on pharmaceuticals is high and has been on an upward trajectory, highlighting its significance in individual healthcare consumption, as reflected in Figure 18.1 (a) (Source: CBO Report on Pharma Spending). On the other hand, when viewed in the context of overall healthcare expenditures, the pharmaceutical sector accounts for a relatively smaller share, as shown in Figure 18.1 (b) (Source: CBO Report on Pharma Spending). This dichotomy underlines the industry’s intricate role in the U.S. healthcare system. It is a sector that commands significant individual spending and is a focus of policy debates, particularly around drug pricing, yet it does not dominate the healthcare budget to the extent that other areas, like hospital care, do.

    "section": "18.2 Prescription Drug Life Cycle",
    "text": "18.2 Prescription Drug Life Cycle\nThe life cycle of a prescription drug in the United States is a multifaceted journey that encompasses several critical phases, each contributing to the drug’s development, approval, and eventual distribution. The process commences with the Research and Development (R&D) phase, a rigorous and time-consuming stage that lays the scientific groundwork for the drug. Following successful R&D, the drug undergoes a stringent approval process led by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which ensures its safety and efficacy. Once approved, the drug enters the marketing phase, where strategic efforts are deployed to promote it to both healthcare professionals and consumers. The final phase involves the sales and distribution of the drug, which can include various channels such as wholesalers, pharmacies, and direct-to-consumer platforms. Each of these phases is integral to the drug’s life cycle and collectively shapes its role and presence in the healthcare market. The following sections provide a brief overview of each phase, highlighting its significance and impact on the drug’s life cycle.\n\n18.2.1 Research and Development\nThe Research and Development (R&D) phase serves as the cornerstone for the development of a new prescription drug, marking the beginning of a lengthy and intricate journey from concept to market. The R&D phase is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, often taking between 10 to 15 years to complete. This phase is divided into several key stages, starting with the discovery of a new compound or biological target. Initial research often involves a host of activities such as screening, target identification, and pre-clinical testing. Less than 5% of candidate compounds make it to pre-clinical testing. But still, these early efforts are pivotal in determining the drug’s potential effectiveness and safety profile.\nAfter initial discovery, the focus shifts to clinical trials, which are designed to rigorously test the drug’s safety and efficacy in human subjects. These trials are subdivided into phases, each with specific objectives and regulatory benchmarks, and can take up to 10 years in total. Only about 20% of drugs in pre-clinical discovery make it to clinical trials. Phase I trials are the first step and involve testing the drug on a small group of healthy volunteers. The primary focus here is on safety and identifying any potential side effects. Once safety is established, the drug moves to Phase II trials, which are conducted on a larger group of participants who have the condition the drug aims to treat. This stage assesses not only safety but also the drug’s efficacy and optimal dosages. Phase III trials expand the scope considerably, involving a much larger and diverse participant pool. These trials are usually randomized and double-blinded, setting the industry standard for evidence on effectiveness and additional safety data.\nUpon successful completion of Phase III trials, the data is compiled into a New Drug Application (NDA) and submitted to the FDA for approval. If approved, some drugs may also undergo Phase IV trials, also known as post-marketing surveillance trials. These are designed to monitor the drug’s performance and safety in the general population over an extended period and may result in a drug being withdrawn from the market or restrictions on its use being imposed. Each of these sub-phases is integral to ensuring that a new drug is both effective and safe for its intended patient population.\n\n\n18.2.2 FDA Approval\nFDA approval is a pivotal milestone in the life cycle of a prescription drug, serving as a regulatory endorsement of the drug’s safety and efficacy for its indicated use. The approval is granted after a thorough review of the data collected through clinical trials, which are submitted as part of the NDA. The FDA evaluates not only the clinical trial results but also the drug’s labeling, manufacturing quality, and proposed marketing strategies. An FDA approval gives the green light for the drug to be marketed and sold to consumers for the specified indications, making it a critical factor for a drug’s commercial success.\nHowever, it’s important to note that FDA approval is often nuanced. The approval may be restricted to specific doses, patient populations, or conditions, and may require additional post-marketing studies or risk management strategies. Moreover, physicians have the discretion to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses that are not explicitly approved by the FDA, although the drugs themselves cannot be marketed for those uses. FDA approval is also crucial for insurance coverage, as many insurance companies require FDA approval as a prerequisite for including a drug in their covered medications list. Thus, FDA approval is not just a regulatory hurdle but a multi-faceted endorsement that impacts various aspects of a drug’s life cycle, from marketing and sales to insurance coverage and clinical practice. Often, companies continue to conduct clinical trials even after initial approval to expand the drug’s approved uses.\nR&D spending alongside new drug approvals are summarized in Figure 18.2 (Source: CBO Report on R&D Spending).\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: R&D Spending and Approvals\n\n\n\n\n18.2.3 Marketing\nThe landscape of marketing expenditures in the pharmaceutical industry has evolved over time, reflecting shifting strategies and priorities. Based on 2018 data, about $6 billion per year is allocated for direct-to-consumer advertising, with television and magazines being the primary mediums. However, this figure pales in comparison to the money spent on detailing, which involves sales representatives visiting physicians. Detailing expenditures are nearly three times higher than that of direct-to-consumer advertising, according to 2008 data. Even more strikingly, the industry spent over $20 billion per year on free samples as of 2005 (Source: GAO Report on DTC Pharma Advertising). These evolving trends highlight the changing role of marketing in the pharmaceutical industry, emphasizing a gradual shift from traditional advertising platforms to more targeted strategies involving healthcare professionals.\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Promotional Spending\n\n\n\n\n18.2.4 Sales\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the supply chain is relatively straightforward. Manufacturers, such as pharmaceutical companies, are the initial point of contact. They primarily sell to wholesalers, which account for 60-70% of sales. Notable wholesalers in this sector include McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen. In some instances, manufacturers sell directly to pharmacies, particularly large chains. From the wholesalers, drugs are sold to various types of pharmacies, both retail and non-retail, including hospitals, nursing homes, and home healthcare providers. Finally, these pharmacies sell the drugs to the end consumers, the patients.\nThe flow of money in this industry is more complicated. Manufacturers are responsible for setting the list prices of drugs. Wholesalers negotiate discounts and rebates and sell the drugs to pharmacies at a markup. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) administer drug formularies and negotiate further discounts and rebates with both manufacturers and insurers. Pharmacies then sell these drugs to patients, also at a markup.\nDetermining the actual price of a drug is a complex task. Insurers pay PBMs to manage drug benefits. Additionally, manufacturers offer rebates to both insurers and PBMs. In the case of Medicaid, mandatory rebates exceed 20% of the wholesale price. For brand-name drugs, the size of the rebates is significant but opaque, making it difficult to ascertain the actual price.\nSeveral factors influence drug pricing. Manufacturer market power plays a crucial role; patent protection can provide up to 20 years of monopoly power, although effective monopoly power is usually closer to 10 years due to the time required for R&D and approval. Other factors affecting price include regulation and price controls, as well as the agency of physicians in prescribing drugs."

    "title": "19  Brand Name Drugs",
    "section": "19.1 Monopoly Pricing",
    "text": "19.1 Monopoly Pricing\nSeveral blockbuster drugs illustrate the monopoly pricing model effectively, given their unique therapeutic profiles and absence of close substitutes during their patent-protected periods. Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, has garnered lifetime revenue exceeding $130 billion, establishing it as a pharmaceutical titan in its category. Humira, used for various autoimmune conditions, has achieved lifetime revenue of over $100 billion, dominating its market segment. Advair, a medication for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also fits this model with lifetime revenue surpassing $90 billion. In each of these cases, the monopoly pricing model aptly captures the market dynamics, as these drugs had no close substitutes while under patent protection.\nIn the simplest economic framework of monopoly pricing without the influence of health insurance, we consider the following model. The inverse demand function for the drug is given by \\(p = a - bq\\), where \\(p\\) is the price and \\(q\\) is the quantity. The cost structure consists of a fixed cost \\(FC\\) and a variable cost component \\(c \\times q\\), leading to total costs of \\(FC + c \\times q\\). The profit function \\(\\pi\\) is therefore \\(\\pi = (a - c)q - bq^2 - FC\\).\nThe profit-maximizing choice of \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) are determined by setting the first derivative of the profit function with respect to \\(q\\) equal to zero. The solutions are: \\[\\begin{align*} q^* &= \\frac{a-c}{2b} \\\\\np^* &= \\frac{a+c}{2} \\end{align*}\\] These equations yield the optimal quantity and price for the monopoly drug manufacturer in a simplified setting, absent of health insurance considerations. This optimal solution is presented graphically in Figure 19.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: Depiction of Monopoly Pricing\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating health insurance adds a layer of complexity to the drug pricing model. One might think that if insurers set co-insurance rates and copays based on a fixed price, the monopolistic pricing dynamics would remain largely unchanged. However, the reality is more intricate. The supply price—the price at which the drug is provided to the patient—will vary depending on the form of cost-sharing involved. Specifically, we must consider the pricing implications under two distinct forms of cost-sharing: coinsurance, where the patient pays a percentage of the drug cost, and copayments, where the patient pays a fixed amount. These forms of cost-sharing each have unique effects on the pricing strategy of brand name drugs, necessitating separate analyses.\n\n19.1.1 Monopoly Pricing with Co-insurance\nIn a setting where coinsurance is the primary form of cost-sharing, the monopoly pricing model needs to be adapted. Let \\(\\alpha\\) denote the coinsurance rate, which falls between 0 and 1. Under this arrangement, for a drug priced at \\(p\\), the patient pays \\(\\alpha \\times p\\) while the insurer covers the remaining \\((1-\\alpha) \\times p\\).\nCrucially, this does not change the consumer’s willingness to pay, but it does alter the inverse demand curve. The new inverse demand function becomes \\(p = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\times (a - b \\times q)\\). This acts as a rotation of the original demand curve, with a new slope of \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\times b\\). The effect is a steeper demand curve, making it less elastic than in the absence of coinsurance. This change in elasticity has implications for the monopoly’s pricing strategy, as it modifies both the slope and position of the demand curve.\nUnder the coinsurance model, the profit-maximizing choices for \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) are modified. By incorporating the new inverse demand function and solving for the maximum profit, the optimal choices become:\n\\[\\begin{align*} q^{*} &= \\frac{a-\\alpha c}{2b} \\\\\np^{*} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{a}{\\alpha}+c\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\nThese equations reflect the modified monopolistic pricing strategy when coinsurance is taken into account, capturing the unique complexities introduced by this form of cost-sharing.\nTo compare the pricing solutions, it is instructive to examine the ratio of monopoly prices with coinsurance (\\(p^{*}_{c}\\)) to those without coinsurance (\\(p^{*}_{nc}\\)). The ratio is given by:\n\\[\\frac{p^{*}_{c}}{p^{*}_{nc}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{a}{\\alpha}+c\\right)}{\\frac{a+c}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\]\nThis result clearly shows that the monopoly price under coinsurance is higher than the price without coinsurance, by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\). Thus, the presence of coinsurance amplifies the market power of the monopolist, allowing for higher prices compared to a setting without insurance.\n\n\n19.1.2 Monopoly Pricing with Co-payments\nIn contrast to coinsurance, copayments involve a fixed amount paid by the patient regardless of the drug’s price. This decouples the demand price, which remains fixed, from the supply price, giving the monopolist freedom to set any price to the insurer. While coinsurance penalizes high prices by shifting down the demand curve, copayments do not exert such downward pressure. In the case of coinsurance, the burden of price increases shifts directly onto patients, thereby exerting downward price pressure. This is a key distinction that makes copayments less effective than coinsurance in controlling drug prices from a monopoly standpoint.\n\n\n19.1.3 Predictions of the Monopoly Pricing Model\nIn light of these theoretical frameworks, we can make some predictions about the real-world applications. Specialty drugs, which are often unique and have few close substitutes, are more likely to be subject to monopoly pricing. Theoretically, one would predict that coinsurance should be more common for specialty drugs compared to more conventional medications. Empirical evidence supports this, showing an increase in coinsurance rates for specialty drugs over time, from 25% in 2006 to 33% in 2009. This trend suggests that the market is adapting in ways consistent with the theoretical predictions, emphasizing the role of coinsurance in regulating the pricing of specialty drugs."

    "text": "19.2 Bertrand Pricing with Differentiated Products\nThe Bertrand model of competition with differentiated products is another useful framework for understanding the economics of brand name drug pricing. This model is applicable to scenarios where multiple products are available, but they are not perfect substitutes for one another. In this setting, the demand curve for each product is downward sloping, but the slope is less steep than in the monopoly model. This reflects the fact that the products are imperfect substitutes, so a price increase for one product will not lead to a complete shift in demand to the other product.\nIn the Bertrand model with differentiated products, we consider a setting where there are multiple products that serve as partial but imperfect substitutes, each with some degree of market power. This scenario is akin to brand-name drugs under patent protection that face some level of competition from other patented drugs. For simplicity, let’s consider a duopoly market with two drugs produced by two different companies.\nWe denote the demand for drug 1 as \\(q_{1}(p_{1},p_{2})\\) and the demand for drug 2 as \\(q_{2}(p_{1},p_{2})\\). Importantly, the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive (\\(\\frac{d q_{i}}{d p_{j}} &gt; 0\\)), indicating that the products are substitutes. As is standard in economics, the own-price elasticity of demand is negative (\\(\\frac{d q_{i}}{d p_{i}} &lt; 0\\)), reflecting the downward-sloping demand curve.\nEach firm takes an action by choosing a price \\(p_{i}\\) for its product. The demand for each firm’s product is modeled as \\[q_{i} = a - bp_{i} + cp_{j},\\] and the corresponding profit function for each firm is \\[\\pi_{i} = (p_{i} - mc_{i})q_{i}.\\] Key parameters in this model include \\(a\\), which represents the maximum quantity when the price is zero; \\(b\\), which captures how the quantity demanded changes with the product’s own price; and \\(c\\), which accounts for the effect of the rival firm’s price on demand. In this setting, each firm strategically chooses its price to maximize its own profit, taking into account these key parameters that capture both the direct and indirect effects on demand.\nIn the Bertrand model, the best response functions for Firm 1 and Firm 2 are given by:\n\\[\\begin{align*} p_{1}^*(p_{2}) &= \\frac{a + cp_{2} + mc_{1}}{2b + 1} \\\\\np_{2}^*(p_{1}) &= \\frac{a + cp_{1} + mc_{2}}{2b + 1} \\end{align*}\\]\nThese functions capture each firm’s optimal pricing strategy in response to the rival firm’s price. Specifically, each firm’s price is a function of the other firm’s price, indicating interdependence in their pricing decisions. These equations serve as the foundation for analyzing equilibrium pricing strategies in markets with differentiated products.\nThe equilibrium prices can be derived by setting the best response functions of the two firms equal to each other. This yields the following Nash equilibrium prices for \\(p_{1}^{*}\\) and \\(p_{2}^{*}\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} p_{1}^{*} &= \\frac{a(2b+1) + c(a + mc_{2}) + mc_{1}(2b+1)}{2b+1 - c^2} \\\\\np_{2}^{*} &= \\frac{a(2b+1) + c(a + mc_{1}) + mc_{2}(2b+1)}{2b+1 - c^2}\\end{align*}\\]\nAt these prices, neither firm has an incentive to unilaterally deviate, as both are maximizing their profits given the other firm’s price. This constitutes a Nash equilibrium in prices for this Bertrand model with differentiated products.\nRecall the classic monopoly pricing formula is given by \\[p_{m} = \\frac{a + mc_{m}}{2b},\\] which typically results in higher prices compared to those set by competitive firms. In the Bertrand model with differentiated products, the degree of differentiation between products, as represented by the parameter \\(c\\), can push prices closer to monopoly levels. It’s also worth noting that, unlike in a pure monopoly where prices depend solely on the monopolist’s own costs, in a Bertrand setting, the equilibrium prices depend on the costs of both competing firms.\nIn a multi-stage game involving an insurer, the insurer initially selects one drug, assigning it a copayment \\(c\\), to include in its formulary while excluding the other. Firms then engage in Bertrand pricing, essentially submitting “bids” for inclusion on the insurer’s formulary. Finally, the insurer selects a drug for the formulary based on these bids.\nIn terms of solution concepts, if Firm 1 sets its price at the original Bertrand price, denoted as \\(p_{1}^{b}\\), Firm 2 can undercut this by just a small amount, \\(\\epsilon\\), effectively capturing most or all of the market. This suggests that \\(p_{1}^{b}, p_{2}^{b}\\) would not be an equilibrium. Firms will lower their prices until the additional profit from extra sales on the formulary is less than the profit generated from the drug being off the formulary.\nThe final implication is that insurers will likely leverage tiered formularies and copayments as mechanisms to exert downward pressure on the prices of differentiated but substitutable on-patent drugs. And this is what we see in practice. For example, take the following quotes from a joint hearing with the DOJ/FTC:\n\nWhen discussing brand name drugs without close substitutes:\n\n\nUnder these circumstances, there is little opportunity for a purchaser to stimulate competition among manufacturers. Manufacturers are roughly free to set launch prices, they rarely discount those prices, and purchasers and price takers.\n\n\nWhen discussing brand name drugs with some imperfect substitutes:\n\n\nThis stage represents the lion’s share of the market at any given time…Depending on how similar the drugs are…organized purchasers have the ability to either switch patients in a medially appropriate way…or at least start new patients on a preferred drug…This is the area where formularies can be applied for the greatest effect on overall costs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed for the approval of generic drugs by the FDA, provided they are bioequivalent to a brand-name drug. Drug manufacturers can submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA, possibly even before the patent on the original drug has expired. The ANDA must demonstrate bioequivalence and adherence to appropriate manufacturing practices. After a review, the FDA may grant tentative approval, with full approval coming after the patent on the original drug expires.\nThe entry of generic drugs into the market often leads to a significant reduction in drug prices. Generally, the generic drug market operates as a competitive market, but there are notable exceptions. One such exception is the Paragraph IV certification, which allows a generic manufacturer to challenge the validity of a patent. A successful challenge leads to a 180-day exclusivity period for the generic drug, whereas an unsuccessful challenge results in a 30-month stay on FDA approval.\nAnother exception is the concept of branded generics, where the original brand-name manufacturer produces a generic version of the drug. These drugs are often priced between the original brand-name price and the typical generic price, leveraging the brand-name reputation. A third exception involves biologics, which are drugs made from living organisms. These drugs are more complex to produce, harder to replicate, and often enjoy longer patent protections (12 years compared to 5 years for traditional drugs). The Affordable Care Act created a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, which are similar but not identical to biologics. The FDA must determine that a biosimilar is “interchangeable” with the original biologic for it to be approved.\nAdditionally, there are other barriers to competition in the generic drug market. For instance, the distribution of generic drugs is often controlled by a few large Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) like Express Scripts, Medco, and CVS Caremark. These PBMs have incentives to favor higher-priced drugs in order to extract larger rebates, which are a significant source of their revenue. Similarly, the retail pharmacy market, dominated by a few large chains like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Rite Aid, also exerts market power that can influence the final sale of drugs.\nAs such, while the introduction of generic drugs has generally led to more competitive pricing, several mechanisms exist that can circumvent this competition, ranging from legal challenges to patent validity, to the influence of PBMs and large pharmacy chains, to the complexities associated with biologics. But even still, over time, the prices of generic drugs have generally trended downwards, remaining significantly lower than their brand-name counterparts. Studies have shown that the prices of generic drugs can drop by as much as 70% to 90% compared to the original brand-name drug within a few years of market entry (Frank and Salkever (1997)). However, the extent of this price reduction can vary depending on several factors, including the number of generic competitors in the market and the specific drug in question (Duggan and Scott Morton (2010)). Despite occasional spikes in prices due to shortages or other market disruptions, the long-term trend has been towards more affordable generic medications. This sustained lower pricing has been pivotal in increasing access to essential medications and reducing the overall burden of healthcare costs on consumers (Sarpatwari et al. (2019)).\n\n\n\n\nDuggan, Mark, and Fiona Scott Morton. 2010. “The Effect of Medicare Part D on Pharmaceutical Prices and Utilization.” American Economic Review 100 (1): 590–607. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.1.590.\n\n\nFrank, Richard G., and David S.

A genuine innovation refers to a new drug that improves upon existing treatments, offering better efficacy or reduced side effects. Despite this, media narratives often overlook the differentiation between novelty and improvement, sometimes conflating the two.\nUnderstanding the drivers of innovation within the pharmaceutical sector is pivotal. Companies are guided by the prospective profits of their drugs, which factor into their research and development (R&D) decisions. This process involves a systematic evaluation of the expected returns from potential new drugs against a backdrop of various costs, including manufacturing, packaging, marketing, and distribution. This evaluation is sometimes referred to as the Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI). Firms will continue to invest in drug development as long as the expected returns, or MEI, exceed the cost of capital, with investment ceasing once MEI equals the cost of capital.\nStrategies to propel innovation forward often pivot on altering the MEI or the cost of capital. Policies to expand the MEI might include modifying marketing regulations or enhancing the demand for certain drugs through measures such as market exclusivity or ensuring coverage under public insurance plans. On the other hand, reducing the cost of capital can be achieved through more accessible funding options like tax credits or grants. However, it’s important to note that such strategies—whether they are ‘pull’ incentives that delay the financial burden until after the drugs are developed, or ‘push’ incentives that require immediate government investment—carry distinct political ramifications and affect different stakeholders."

    "text": "21.2 The Interplay of Regulation and Pharmaceutical Innovation\nRegulatory frameworks in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly concerning pricing, are crucial to the innovation landscape. Price regulations like reference pricing or direct price caps can have a disincentive effect on innovation by diminishing the MEI. Research has suggested that the price elasticity of R&D is around 0.6, indicating that a 10% reduction in drug prices could potentially lead to a 6% decrease in R&D investment. It raises the question of which specific innovations might be deterred due to such pricing pressures, a query that remains challenging to answer.\nDiscussion within the academic community has highlighted the discrepancy in drug prices and innovation rates, as discussed in Kesselheim, Avorn, and Sarpatwari (2016). This discourse underscores the U.S.’s position as an outlier in terms of pharmaceutical spending and the growth rate of such spending when compared to peer nations. Notwithstanding the high costs, it’s critical to acknowledge that even expensive drugs like Sovaldi for hepatitis C can represent cost-effective treatments given their therapeutic benefits.\n\n21.2.1 Factors affecting pharma prices\nVarious factors contribute to the rising costs of pharmaceuticals, raising critical research questions regarding the drivers of these increases and potential policy interventions that can align drug prices with their true value, ensuring equitable access. The stark contrast between brand name and generic drug prices often garners attention, particularly when price hikes in generics, which are meant to be affordable alternatives, are noted. Cases like the 5500% increase in the price of Daraprim, a treatment for toxoplasmosis, exemplify the complexities within the industry, where monopoly pricing can occur even in the absence of patent protection.\nThe mechanisms behind such high prices for pharmaceuticals are multifaceted, involving manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), insurers, and pharmacies, with little regulation to directly influence price setting. Comparatively, in markets like the UK, cost-effectiveness thresholds are mandated, dictating coverage eligibility and thus, indirectly, pricing.\nFirst, one clear factor affecting pharma prices is patent protection. Patent protection affords a period of market exclusivity that typically extends for 20 years, starting before a drug receives approval. Companies can seek extensions on these patents, resulting in additional market exclusivity. But even in cases with multiple substitute products, competition remains limited, often due to market fragmentation, informational asymmetries, and complexities in physician prescribing behaviors.\nSecond, even after the initial patent protection, firms can delay generic entry for some time. Such strategies include securing additional patents for minor modifications to existing drugs or engaging in settlement agreements with generic manufacturers.\nAnd third, even after generic entry, barriers to competition persist. Such barriers are influenced by a variety of legislative and regulatory practices across states that affect the substitution of brand name drugs with generics.\nUltimately, the industry justifies high drug prices by citing significant R&D expenditures. While it’s true that R&D expenditures are substantial, the role of public and academic institutions in the early stages of many transformative drug developments may weaken this rationale. With rising drug prices becoming increasingly unsustainable, discussions on federal and state policy reforms have come to the forefront."

(2023), the authors recommend a recalibration of international spending responsibilities, advocating for higher drug prices in other countries as a potentially more effective policy than simply lowering prices within the U.S. alone.\nThis nuanced conversation addresses the intricate balance between fostering innovation through adequate funding mechanisms and ensuring the affordability and accessibility of pharmaceuticals on a global scale.

    "section": "1.2 How Insurers Manage Costs",
    "text": "1.2 How Insurers Manage Costs\nWe have described insurance as a financial contract that pools risk across enrollees. But insurers do more than collect premiums and pay claims. Because health care is expensive, insurers also try to manage where and how patients receive care. This effort to control utilization and costs has given rise to what is broadly called managed care.\n\n1.2.1 Managed Care\nOne common term you will hear in connection with health insurance is managed care (Definition 1.1). “Management” in this context means that the insurer directs enrollees toward certain providers over others, usually reflecting the prices negotiated with those providers.\nFor example, suppose there are two large hospital systems in a market, and an insurer has negotiated lower payments with Hospital A. If Hospital A offers adequate quality and a wide range of services, the insurer wants enrollees to use it rather than Hospital B, since that reduces costs. To achieve this, the insurer might lower the patient’s out-of-pocket payment if care is received at Hospital A.\nThis arrangement resembles a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), in which the insurer still covers some costs at Hospital B but at a less generous rate. Alternatively, the insurer might refuse to pay for care at Hospital B altogether. This is the logic of a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), where coverage is limited to a defined set of providers. In both cases, the insurer uses financial incentives to steer patients toward preferred providers.\nPPOs and HMOs are the most common forms of managed care insurance products in the United States.\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Managed Care) A health insurance product that attempts to manage utilization of health care among its enrollees, often by assigning providers (physicians, hospitals, etc.) into tiers based on negotiated prices.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Networks\nA central tool of managed care is the construction of a provider network (Definition 1.2). Insurers negotiate agreements with certain hospitals, physicians, and other providers, designating them as “preferred” sources of care. Providers included in these agreements are considered in-network, meaning the insurer will cover care received from them, subject to the cost-sharing rules of the plan. By contrast, out-of-network providers have no such agreement, and patients are usually responsible for the full bill if they choose to use them.\nThe financial consequences of going out-of-network can be severe. Because out-of-network bills are based on the provider’s charges (essentially a sticker price) rather than the negotiated allowed amounts, patients may face costs that are many times higher than in-network rates (see Section 1.4). For example, an in-network MRI might leave a patient with a $200 co-insurance bill, while the same scan out-of-network could cost the patient over $2,000.\n\nDefinition 1.2 (Insurance Networks) A set of providers for which the insurer has agreed to pay some portion of care received, conditional on other cost-sharing terms of the insurance contract. The most common network-based insurance products are Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). PPOs often use a tiered structure, where patients pay less at higher-tier providers, while HMOs typically make a sharper distinction between in-network and out-of-network coverage.\n\nNetworks and managed care are closely linked. By deciding which providers are in-network and under what terms, insurers influence where patients seek care. The possibility of exclusion from a network—or assignment to a less favorable tier—also gives insurers bargaining power when negotiating prices with providers.",

    "section": "1.3 What Patients Pay",
    "text": "1.3 What Patients Pay\nEvery health insurance plan has two sides: what the insurer covers and what the patient pays. Up to this point we have focused on how insurers organize networks and manage costs. From the patient’s perspective, however, the most tangible features of an insurance product are the payments they are responsible for. These include the premium—the fixed monthly amount paid for coverage—as well as various forms of cost-sharing that apply when care is actually received, such as the deductible, co-payment, and co-insurance. Understanding these terms is essential to interpreting how insurance products work in practice and how they affect access to care.\n\n1.3.1 Premiums\nA premium is the fixed amount an enrollee pays each month for health insurance coverage, regardless of whether any care is received. In employer-sponsored plans (the most common form of private insurance), this cost is typically shared between the employee and the employer.\nPremiums have risen steadily over time, as shown in Figure 1.1. Several factors contribute: advances in medical technology and pharmaceuticals, greater demand for care due to an aging population and rising rates of chronic disease, and the administrative and regulatory costs of running insurance plans. Together, these pressures have made premiums an increasing financial burden for households and employers alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Premiums\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Cost-sharing\nWhile premiums must be paid every month, cost-sharing refers to what patients pay when they actually use health care. Cost-sharing provisions determine the out-of-pocket expenses a patient faces once they receive care. The three most common forms are the deductible (Definition 1.3), co-insurance (Definition 1.4), and co-payment (Definition 1.5).\nFigure Figure 1.2 shows that over time, insurers have relied more heavily on high deductibles and co-insurance, while the use of co-payments has declined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Cost-sharing\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.3 (Deductible) The amount a patient must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer pays anything. For example, with a $2,000 deductible, a patient must first cover $2,000 in health care costs each year before insurance begins contributing. Once this threshold is reached, the deductible is considered “met.”\n\n\nDefinition 1.4 (Co-insurance) A percentage of costs the patient pays after meeting the deductible. For example, with a 20% co-insurance rate, a patient who has already met the deductible and then receives a $5,000 hospital bill would pay $1,000 (20%), while the insurer pays the remaining 80%. Co-insurance is common for larger, less predictable services such as hospital stays or emergency visits.\n\n\nDefinition 1.5 (Co-payment) A fixed dollar amount the patient pays for a specific service after meeting the deductible. Co-payments are more common for lower-cost, predictable services such as physician office visits or prescription drugs. For instance, a plan might require a $20 co-pay for a doctor’s visit, with the insurer covering the remainder.\n\nNote that co-insurance and co-payments can coexist within the same plan. Office visits may involve a co-payment, while hospital services may involve co-insurance. Importantly, monthly premiums are not considered cost-sharing, because they are owed whether or not any health care is used. Cost-sharing applies only to expenses incurred when care is actually received.",

    "text": "4.1 Why do we care?\nLet’s motivate some of this with a simple story of Humana and the ACA exchanges. In 2018, Humana withdrew from the ACA exchanges citing an “unbalanced risk pool” due to the results of the 2017 open enrollment period. The risk pool refers to the collection of policyholders and their corresponding risk levels. In this context, Humana essentially claimed that their enrollees were too sick and too expensive relative to the plan premiums. Humana had also just had their proposed merger with Aetna blocked by the Department of Justice (details here), which may have also been related to the decision to drop out of the ACA exchanges.\nManaging the risk pool is critical for insurers (not just health insurers). One reason that this is so important is because of something called “community rating” which sets restrictions on how much insurers can change premiums for different enrollees in the same market. While there is some opportunity to charge some enrollees different premiums, it’s useful just to think of community rating as requiring all enrollees in a given market to be charged with the same premium. So, since insurers can’t ask some people to pay more than others, they have to set their premiums so that the revenue collected from the very healthy enrollees (those that don’t use much health care) offsets any losses paid out to providers for very unhealthy enrollees (those that use lots of health care, or those that are just very unlucky in a given year). If an insurer underestimates the share of high-need patients enrolling in a plan, then they will have an “unbalanced risk pool” and incur more expenses than expected, potentially to the point of eroding any profits from the low-need enrollees.\nFigure 4.1 highlights the relationship between health care utilization and patients’ underlying health status, where we see that those self-reported to be of low health also have the highest health care expenditures and most frequent encounters with the health care system. As is clear from these figures, insurers can expect to incur more costs as less healthy patients enroll in their plans.\nSo insurers really need to know how to price their products appropriately. To do that, they need to understand what determines someone’s willingness to pay for health insurance. That’s where we’re headed in this chapter.",

Covered services — the types of care included in the plan (e.g., hospital visits, prescription drugs, mental health services). Some services may be excluded or subject to limitations.\n2. Premium and cost-sharing rules — the financial terms that specify how much patients must contribute when using care. These include the deductible, co-payments, and co-insurance.\nThese design choices shape patient access to care and the overall generosity of the plan.

    "text": "2.1.1 History of Private Health Insurance\nThe origins of modern health insurance in the United States can be traced to a modest experiment in Dallas in 1929. Baylor University Hospital offered local schoolteachers a simple arrangement: for six dollars a year—about one hundred dollars in today’s dollars—teachers were guaranteed up to twenty-one days of hospital care. The plan resembled a subscription, but it was revolutionary. It gave teachers financial protection against an expensive and uncertain event, and it provided the hospital with a predictable stream of revenue.\nThis model spread quickly. By the early 1930s, hospitals across the country had organized similar prepayment schemes under the name Blue Cross. A few years later, physicians developed parallel plans known as Blue Shield. Together, Blue Cross and Blue Shield dominated the early insurance market, operating as nonprofit organizations that were exempt from many state regulations. Hospitals were typically reimbursed on a cost-plus basis, meaning they were paid for their actual costs plus a margin. While this guaranteed hospital solvency, it also muted incentives for cost control.\nBy the 1940s, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans covered millions of Americans. Their growth established two features that remain central to U.S. health insurance: coverage tied to institutions rather than a national program, and payment systems that often encouraged higher rather than lower spending. Yet the story did not stop there. Even as Blue Cross and Blue Shield became household names, a different path was emerging—one that would make employers the central link between most Americans and their health insurance.\n\n\n2.1.2 Employer Sponsored Insurance\nEmployer-sponsored insurance, or ESI, is today the most common way that non-elderly Americans obtain coverage. Its rise was not inevitable but reflected a mix of economic pressures and policy choices in the mid-twentieth century.\nDuring World War II, wage and price controls limited employers’ ability to raise salaries. To compete for scarce workers, firms began offering more generous fringe benefits, including health insurance. A decade later, federal tax policy solidified this practice. In 1954, Congress excluded employer contributions to health insurance from employees’ taxable income. For workers, this meant that a dollar of health insurance was worth more than a dollar of wages, since the former was untaxed. Together, wartime wage controls and the tax exclusion made health insurance through the workplace the norm.\nThe basic structure of ESI has remained remarkably stable. Employers typically pay most of the premium, while employees contribute the remainder through pre-tax payroll deductions. Large firms often self-insure, bearing the financial risk of claims while hiring an insurer to administer the plan. Because self-insured plans are governed by federal law under ERISA, they are largely shielded from state insurance regulations and premium taxes. This makes ESI especially attractive for firms that operate in multiple states.\nDespite repeated reforms in other parts of the health system, federal policy has largely left ESI untouched. As a result, the United States is unusual among high-income countries in continuing to rely on employers as the primary source of coverage for working-age adults. Still, not everyone can or does obtain insurance through a job, which brings us to the next major pathway: the individual or “non-group” market.\n\n\n2.1.3 Non-group health insurance\nNot everyone has access to insurance through an employer, and not everyone qualifies for a public program. For these individuals and families, the alternative is to purchase coverage directly in what is known as the non-group or individual market. This market has existed for decades, but prior to the Affordable Care Act it was notoriously difficult to navigate. Insurers could deny coverage or charge very high premiums to people with pre-existing conditions, impose annual or lifetime benefit limits, and sell plans that excluded important services. As a result, many people who most needed coverage were least able to obtain it.\nThe ACA fundamentally reshaped this market. Beginning in 2014, it created state-based or federally run marketplaces (often called “exchanges”) where individuals could compare and purchase standardized plans. These marketplaces required insurers to cover a core set of “essential health benefits,” prohibited discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, and offered income-based subsidies to make coverage more affordable. These reforms dramatically expanded access to non-group insurance, especially in states that did not expand Medicaid.\nIt is worth noting that the ACA also established SHOP exchanges for small employers, creating a parallel marketplace in the small-group sector. In practice, however, SHOP coverage has remained very limited, and the exchanges are most significant as a channel for individual (non-group) plans.\nEven after these reforms, non-group insurance remains a relatively small share of overall coverage compared with employer-sponsored insurance and public programs. Still, for millions of people without access to those other pathways, it has become an essential option.",

    "text": "2.2 Public Insurance\nBut not all coverage flows through employers or the individual market. A large share of the population relies on publicly financed programs, each with distinct rules and target groups. Over time, the United States has developed several public programs that together insure tens of millions of people. These programs differ in who they cover, how they are financed, and how they pay providers, but they all reflect the idea that certain populations should have guaranteed access to health care regardless of employment or income. The major public programs are Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration, along with TRICARE for active-duty service members and their families.\n\n2.2.1 Medicare\nCreated in 1965, Medicare provides health insurance primarily to people aged sixty-five and older, as well as to certain younger adults with disabilities. Traditional, or “Original,” Medicare includes Part A, which covers inpatient hospital and post-acute services, and Part B, which covers physician and outpatient services. Part A is usually premium-free for those who have contributed payroll taxes, while Part B requires a monthly premium. Beneficiaries can see any provider who accepts Medicare, making the program broad in scope. Hospitals are paid under prospective payment systems such as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), and physicians are paid through standardized fee schedules. Although this provides stable access to care, beneficiaries are still responsible for deductibles and co-insurance (Definition 1.3; Definition 1.4), so many purchase supplemental Medigap policies.\nSince 2003, beneficiaries have also had the option of enrolling in Medicare Advantage (Part C). Under this arrangement, the federal government pays private insurers a risk-adjusted capitation for each enrollee, and the insurer provides all Medicare benefits, often bundling in extras like prescription drug coverage (Part D), vision, or dental care. Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as managed care products (Definition 1.1) with provider networks (Definition 1.2), utilization management, and cost-sharing rules (Section 1.3.2). Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has grown steadily, and today roughly half of all Medicare beneficiaries are in these plans.\n\n\n2.2.2 Medicaid\nMedicaid, also enacted in 1965, is a joint federal–state program that provides coverage to low-income adults and children, pregnant people, people with disabilities, and many elderly individuals needing long-term care. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid is means-tested, and eligibility rules vary by state within federal guidelines. The program covers a wide range of services, including hospital care, physician visits, prescription drugs, preventive care, and long-term services and supports.\nHistorically, states paid providers directly under fee schedules, but today most Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), which operate on the same logic as other managed care products (Definition 1.1). In this arrangement, states pay insurers a capitated rate per enrollee, and the insurer then contracts with providers. This shift has been motivated by goals of cost control, care coordination, and improved access. Federal matching funds (FMAP) make Medicaid one of the largest budget items in both state and federal health spending. The Affordable Care Act further expanded Medicaid eligibility in participating states, contributing to the sharp decline in the uninsured rate after 2014.\n\n\n2.2.3 Veterans Health Administration and TRICARE\nThe Veterans Health Administration (VA) operates as an integrated insurer and provider system, delivering care directly through a nationwide network of VA hospitals and clinics. Funded through congressional appropriations, the VA employs its own clinicians and emphasizes services tailored to the needs of veterans, such as treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Eligible veterans face little or no cost for care, though eligibility rules can be complex.\nIn parallel, the Department of Defense administers TRICARE, which provides health insurance to active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. Unlike the VA, TRICARE functions more like a traditional insurance product, contracting with private networks (Definition 1.2) and offering a range of plan types. While TRICARE covers a broader population, the VA remains focused on veterans and operates its own delivery system.",

    "section": "2.3 How Insurers Pay Providers",
    "text": "2.3 How Insurers Pay Providers\nThe different sources of insurance we have covered—private, Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA—share the same ultimate task: paying providers for care. Yet the way they do so varies, and these differences help explain both how money flows through the health system and why incentives for hospitals and physicians look the way they do.\n\nPrivate Insurance (including MA)\nPrivate insurers, whether through employer-sponsored coverage, direct purchase, or Medicare Advantage, typically negotiate contracts with providers in advance. These contracts establish the allowed amounts they will pay for specific services, as opposed to the provider’s list charges (Section 1.4). When a patient receives care, the provider submits a claim, and the insurer pays the agreed rate—minus any deductible, co-payment, or co-insurance owed by the patient (Section 1.3.2).\nIn recent years, some insurers have moved toward capitated payments, in which providers are paid a fixed amount per enrollee rather than per service. Capitation is most common in systems that integrate insurance and delivery, such as Kaiser Permanente. For most private coverage, however, payment remains rooted in negotiated fee-for-service contracts.\n\n\nTraditional Medicare\nMedicare’s fee-for-service model relies on administratively set prices rather than individual negotiation. Hospitals are paid prospectively through Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), which assign each inpatient admission to a category with a fixed payment rate. Physicians are reimbursed under a standardized fee schedule. Beneficiaries are still responsible for some cost-sharing (Section 1.3.2), but providers cannot balance-bill beyond the allowed Medicare amounts. This structure provides stable access but also leaves providers little flexibility to negotiate higher rates.\n\n\nMedicaid\nMedicaid payment varies by state. In traditional fee-for-service Medicaid, providers are reimbursed according to state-determined fee schedules, which generally pay less than Medicare or commercial insurance. Today, however, most enrollees are in Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) (Definition 1.1). States pay these MCOs a capitated rate per enrollee, and the insurer then contracts with providers, functioning much like private insurance but with lower overall payment levels.\n\n\nVeterans Health Administration\nThe VA stands apart as both insurer and provider. Rather than paying outside hospitals and physicians, it operates its own network of hospitals and clinics and directly employs clinicians. Funding comes through congressional appropriations, which cover salaries, facilities, and equipment. Veterans may face modest co-pays, but for most services the VA functions as a fully integrated, tax-funded delivery system.",

    "text": "2.4 Final Thoughts\nTaken together, these payment systems reinforce the fragmented nature of U.S. health insurance. Whether a provider is paid according to negotiated rates, a federal fee schedule, or a congressional appropriation depends not on the service itself, but on who the patient happens to be insured by. This patchwork produces stark differences in what patients pay, what providers earn, and how care is delivered. In the chapters that follow, we will look more closely at these differences, particularly how insurers negotiate prices, how benefit design shapes patient behavior, and how providers respond to the incentives embedded in each payment system.",
